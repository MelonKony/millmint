<span class="dropcap">P</span>oetry in Oslola was something ordinary people did and had no stigma attached to it. It came from the tradition of the early sagas, which were written in rhythmic stanzas and passed down orally. The Algics had been doing something similar even before that but the earliest Algic poems were written down by Scandinavians.

‘Fear is what drives me,’ Tzipora said. ‘I’m a very fearful person.’

‘What does that mean?’

‘That if you want me to do something, you should scare me.’

‘How do I scare you?’

‘I don’t know. I’m not scared easily. I scare from big things, I’m not scared of getting a slap or a spider.’
