The way I'm doing things now isn't working -- I don't enjoy social media, or marketing my work. I haven't done much to grow my audience these last few years. And I'm surrounded by unfinished projects; difficult and wonderful things that refuse to move.

2022 is the end of the COVID era for me. I'm moving house again, moving around again (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ª). These are all good things. I'm healthier when I'm learning, and I've learned a lot these last couple months.

I have a plan for 2023:

1. Treat this work as work.
2. Draw all of the time, especially when I don't have time.
3. Focus on key goals.
4. Realise the projects I love.

Those four points are straightforward. I need to commit to a personal schedule, work as though I'm being paid for it, find moments to draw between other commitments, and finish the comic and work on some merchandise.

This all adds up to be maintenance. It's not very interesting, but it is important, and it's what I'm most in need of at the moment. Two years of COVID and stagnation has left me listless and a little burnt out. I need to take back the initiative and meet my ten years in the sun.
