I've visited the UK twice in about a month now. This wasn't planned -- it just worked out that way. I live an absurd life, travelling, walking and drawing where I can. I'm not quite a bum -- I stay in cheap places and travel well -- but not quite a conventional tourist, either. I don't make much money, but I don't spent much money either. It all evens out.
