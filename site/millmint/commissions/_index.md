You know what I draw -- it's probably how you found me. It should be no surprise then that I work best in my element. Consider how your commission can use my strengths as an artist, and I'll help you develop a concept.

| Good Concepts | I will not draw |
|---|---|
| <ul> <li>People & characters</li> <li>Uniforms & design</li> <li>Architecture & machines</li> <li>Scenes & places</li> </ul> | Pornographic, obscene,<br> immoral, or otherwise<br> offensive concepts |

These are artworks that are good for developing an idea. They're rough around the edges, usually uncoloured, and full of energy. Prices vary on their scope and colour.

### Process & delivery

1. Contact me with your idea. We'll talk about what you want and whether I'm a good fit. If you decide to commission me, I'll give a quote in writing and an estimated completion date.
2. I'll produce a preliminary sketch. This will be used as a reference for the finished work, and is a good time to make conceptual changes.
3. If you like what you see, you'll pay Â½ the price quoted as a deposit. At this point, you're committed to the work.
4. I'll finish the commission, and will give updates on request.
5. Once finished, I'll forward a watermarked image as a preview. If you're satisfied, you'll receive your artwork and a **MillMint Gift Basketâ„¢** upon payment of the outstanding sum.
