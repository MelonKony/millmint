<span class="dropcap">O</span>nce each term every class went somewhere for two or three nights. A dozen students stood out on the platform and a loose piece of newspaper rolled over and over across it. They had run out of things to say on the train and were now bored and listless, waiting for the dim train lamps to emerge from the fog a ways down the track. There was nothing here at all -- a sign with *Amelda*, the station name; a rusted over maintenance car in a forgotten siding; a sheet of newspaper rolling over and over. This was a place for people waiting to die, milling around at the edge between life and death. It was not a place for Class 6 on a Wednesday afternoon.

The morning had brought a cool mist down from the glacier. They’d left the city when it was a bright, clear morning in May. Now the city was gone; May was gone. This was an in-between place. It was easy to see why Algic mysticism had emerged organically out of this land.

Tzipora was pacing slowly up and down the platform because she slept poorly and worried if she stopped she would fall asleep. The concrete platform had been worn smooth at the stairs but there was no one around. She thought that was interesting. She’d drawn her navy cape tight beneath a grey nylon overslip that shimmered bright with drops of mist. They had to wear regular uniform while travelling, which irritated the regular anarchism of teenagers who regarded these rituals as tedious when they were packing sports kit anyway. It did not bother Tzipora because she did not regard clothes separately, nor did she really recognise the difference between regular uniform and the sports kit. She could run just as fast in either, and she’d proved it by nearly missing the train that morning.

‘Have you met anyone from Lucia?’ Tzipora asked suddenly, pulling on the drawstring of her cape. Cobian was sitting neatly closer to the rest of the group and looked up from her book.

‘No. My brother has a friend from Barbados and my dad worked with someone from Madiana. I’ve never met anyone from Lucia.’

‘Are they similar? I don’t know anything about that part of the Caribbean.’

‘I don’t know. I don’t think so. They were ruled by different Europeans. Lucians could be French, or British, or god-knows-what. Everyone was getting in on it back then.’

‘A bit concerning we don’t know anything about them,’ Tzipora said, shuffling over. ‘They might not be as open-minded as we are. A trip to the highlands won’t be much fun if they hate our weather and food and personality.’

‘I wouldn’t worry what they think. I’ve got my own plans anyway.’

‘To walk to the faerie ponds with me?’

‘No. That’s your plan. I’m going to look for inspiration in the landscape because I’m writing a short story about a girl who lives in the highlands.’

Tzipora made a face and said ‘wow. Maybe I should write something.’

‘Please don’t,’ Cobian frowned. ‘Don’t compete with me.
