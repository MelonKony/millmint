Hello my lovelies,

Just a short update on where I’m at as we pass mid-month. I’ve pushed a couple of things back a day or two to finish a very cool/special post. You’ll see it on the reddit soon — it’ll be a really nice painting, and nothing like I’ve ever done before. **Before the weekend**.

I was hesitant to promise a timeframe for the comic draft, and for good reason. I haven’t done anything like this before, so I don’t have a reference for how much work and time these things take. I’ve had three years now to narrow down and figure out what sort of schedule works for posts via reddit, and I’ve got a big of an adjustment period here. **I’m hoping to have the draft up for patrons here soon, within a week**. In future, I think a chapter a month is perfectly feasible, but there’s a lot to learn — formats, comic stylisation, and even black and white illustration are pretty new to me. So stay tuned for the draft.

The stamps are coming along well! I’ve had to redraw the post office post since the original didn’t really work out, and that will be out before the end of the month. Little sketches and hopefully another post or two are also mapped out between here and then.

Finally, since we’ve hit $100/month on Patreon, that means **we can start talking about a fun reward**. Previously, I reached out to a print company, tabulated how much it would cost per unit, then simply subtracted your lifetime donation to the project from your order. The Tzipo-stcards cost around $20 to print and ship, so anyone who had donated a total of $20 over their Patreon pledge would get them for “free”. The same system will work here. Any patron is entitled to one — if your total pledges are under the cost of manufacture, you can simply make up the difference. You won't miss out if you don't want to.

I’m currently looking into little enamel pins, since **I love pins**, but I’ll have a poll up within the next week to see if you’d prefer any alternatives.

As always, sincere thanks for your patronage. It means a lot.

Love

Melon
