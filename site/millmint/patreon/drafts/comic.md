✿ **Note from the Editor:**
This draft represents the final copy used as a reference for inking -- the final lines. It's not pretty, but it is legible, and once all the inking and lettering and tone work is done it'll be quite special. **There are a couple of pages missing**. One between the airport and the cafe, and another to fill out the conversation in the cafe. Those will arrive soon. Thank you kindly for your support.
