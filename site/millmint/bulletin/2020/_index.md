**âœ¿ Note from the Editor**

The bulletin was an experiment created in May 2020 to supplement content posted to reddit. It featured project updates, news relevant to the project, and contributing essays from friends of the project. It was published monthly via direct email subscription. It has been replaced by the *Petticoat Research Bulletin*.

Listed below are the issues of The *Atlantic* distributed in 2020.
