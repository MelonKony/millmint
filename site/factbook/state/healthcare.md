## Overview

As elsewhere in [[Vekllei]], <span class="fi fi-healthcare fis"></span> healthcare is centralised in planning and standards and decentralised in delivery. Each [republic](/constituents/) has a Health Service which governs regional policy. Healthcare is operated and legislated by the [[Parliament of Health]]. Almost all healthcare available in Vekllei comes through public financing and providers. There are two private hospitals in the country which provide specialised care to foreigners.

The current system has good outcomes, and its public services are widely available to residents.

### Psychiatric Health

The country has six psychiatric hospitals. The largest is the [[Bethlehem Psychiatric Hospital]] in [[Paria]], which covers over 300 acres. Most mental health treatment occurs through outpatient services at general hospitals or through municipal health centres.

Community mental health programmes operate in most municipalities, with psychiatric nurses and social workers conducting home visits and coordinating care. This approach keeps most patients in their communities rather than in institutional settings.

## Pharmaceuticals and Medicine

The Commonwealth Government manufactures most pharmaceuticals domestically through the National Pharmaceutical Bureau. This bureau operates production facilities in [[Oslola]], [[Kairi]] and [[Praia]], which produce generic medications and some specialist drugs.

Foreign medicines are imported through the Municipal Pharmacy Agreements (MPA), which negotiate bulk purchasing with overseas manufacturers. The Medicines Authority approves all drugs for use in Vekllei and maintains a national formulary that lists approved medications.

Pharmacies are operated by municipalities and staffed by registered pharmacists. Most medicines are dispensed without charge, though some specialist medications require approval from a GP or consultant. The system maintains tight controls on controlled substances and antibiotics.

## Funding and Accounting

Hospitals and staff are funded by National Health Authorities, which receive block grants from the federal Health Secretariat. These grants are calculated based on population, demographic factors and historical costs. Republics with older populations or scattered island communities receive additional funding.

Like all Vekllei [[state industry|government enterprises]], healthcare in Vekllei uses [[accounted revenue|commercial accounting systems]] and records spending. Although money is not actually used, these budgets are audited regularly and expenditure is determined through an extensive costing exercise.

Healthcare delivery costs are often opaque in Vekllei's integrated health systems, in which a pharmaceutical can be produced, shipped and administered without material financial cost. Instead, prices are affixed by the Health Accounting Office and used as guides for cost. These budgets compel health services to discipline their costs.

The Health Finance Board reviews spending quarterly and can impose restrictions on republics that exceed their budgets. Capital expenditure for new facilities or equipment requires separate approval from the Commonwealth Health Secretariat.

## Role of Government

{{</note>}}

Public healthcare is integrated into Vekllei's cascading federal system. National Health Authorities (NHAs) are tasked with local policy and the delivery of most care, including health promotion programmes and the administration of hospitals. The federal Health Secretariat designs commonwealth policy, and conducts most health planning and research. The federal health authorities also purchase foreign imports necessary for domestic healthcare, including the Community Pharmacy Agreements (CPA) which negotiate foreign medicine prices.

The foundation of Vekllei public health, however, lies in the municipalities. General Practitioners (GPs) and Family Doctors are the main primary care providers in the country, and are employed by [municipal](/polis/) health councils.

The Parliament of Health oversees the entire system and has legislative authority over health policy. Its 35 members include elected representatives from republic assemblies, health professionals and citizens selected by sortition from the health sector. This body sets national standards, approves major policy changes and adjudicates disputes between different levels of the health system.

Medical professionals require registration with the Health Sciences Authority, which maintains standards and handles disciplinary matters. Doctors, nurses and allied health workers must complete continuing education requirements and undergo periodic recertification.
