Almost all healthcare available in Vekllei comes through public financing and providers. There are two private hospitals in the country which provide specialised care to foreigners.

The current system has good outcomes, and its public services are widely available to residents.

Like all Vekllei [state-owned enterprises](/assets/), healthcare in Vekllei uses commercial accounting systems and records spending. Although money is not actually used, these budgets are audited regularly and expenditure is determined through an extensive costing exercise.

Healthcare delivery costs are often opaque in Vekllei's integrated health systems, in which a pharmaceutical can be produced, shipped and administered without material financial cost. Instead, prices are affixed by the Health Accounting Office and used as guides for cost. These budgets compel health services to discipline their costs.

## Role of Government

Public healthcare is integrated into Vekllei's cascading federal system. National Health Authorities (NHAs) are tasked with local policy and the delivery of most care, including health promotion programmes and the administration of hospitals. The federal Health Secretariat designs commonwealth policy, and conducts most health planning and research. The federal health authorities also purchase foreign imports necessary for domestic healthcare, including the Community Pharmacy Agreements (CPA) which negotiate foreign medicine prices.

The foundation of Vekllei public health, however, lies in the municipalities. General Practitioners (GPs) and Family Doctors are the main primary care providers in the country, and are employed by [municipal](/polis/) health councils.
