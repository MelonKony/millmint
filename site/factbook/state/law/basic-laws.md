The Basic Laws of the [[Vekllei]] are a quasi-constitutional laws that inform in detail aspects of Vekllei government and state not provided in the [Constitution](/constitution/). They are superior to other types of legislation in the country, and can only be overturned by a supermajority vote in the Senate, a majority referendum of the Commonwealth and approval of the [[Cabinet]]. Individual acts of parliament are subordinated to the basic law they are enacted under, and serve both as conventional legislation and amendments to the overall basic law.

## Basic Laws

Basic Laws are broad legislative umbrellas. They outline the general principles and high-level structure for a specific area of Commonwealth life. More detailed, year-dated acts, like the *Commonwealth Communications Act* (2045), are considered amendments or refinements that sit underneath a relevant Basic Law. This allows for clear, simple organisation and avoids the need for a new Basic Law for every single piece of legislation.

The system is designed so that while specific acts can be amended or repealed, the foundational principles enshrined in the Basic Law remain stable and secure. A new Basic Law is only needed when a completely new area of federal authority is established.
