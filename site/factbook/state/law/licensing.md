**Professional licensing** in Vekllei operates on a simple principle: you can do what you want on your own scale, but accessing shared infrastructure and greater resources requires demonstrating competence. This approach keeps authorities out of personal affairs while protecting the systems that connect Vekllei communities and enable modern life.

The *Commonwealth Professions Act (2023)* establishes that licensing applies primarily to shared systems rather than individual practice. This creates a practical distinction that most people understand. You can drive around your own property or local roads without a licence, but accessing high-speed motorways between towns requires proper credentials. The difference reflects the scale of potential consequences.

This principle extends across most areas of professional life.[^examples] Medical practitioners can provide basic care and traditional healing without formal credentials, but accessing pharmaceutical supply chains, hospital facilities or controlled medications requires licensing. The same logic applies to electrical work: anyone can wire their own shed, but connecting to the grid requires proper licensing to ensure the safety of the entire community. Households can dig wells or collect rainwater without licensing, but connecting to municipal water supplies requires approval, and so on.[^water]

The *commons* -- Vekllei's moneyless domestic economy -- naturally implies this approach. Complex professional work typically requires access to institutional resources, which are only available through established professional networks. A mechanic working independently can repair vehicles with basic tools but needs integration with professional systems to access expertise or new parts. This creates a natural barrier to complex work without legal restrictions on routine tasks.

The system affects the social nature of work in the country. Traditional apprenticeship relationships have strengthened as formal credentialing has become less significant for basic work. Innovation has also flourished in areas where reduced barriers to entry allow creative problem-solving. The system works best, and is most prevalent, in the smaller, codependent communities of Vekllei's scattered island geography.

[^examples]: The system adapts to local conditions. In Oslola, traditional guilds blend with modern licensing requirements, while in the Kalina republics traditional healing practices are integrated with modern medical systems.
[^water]: Maritime communities also show this flexibility. Local fishermen work within their traditional waters without licensing, but accessing commercial shipping lanes requires proper credentials.
