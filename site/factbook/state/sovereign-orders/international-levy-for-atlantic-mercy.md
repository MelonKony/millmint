<span class="fi fi-international-levy-for-atlantic-mercy fis"></span> **The International Levy for Atlantic Mercy** is a [[sovereign orders|sovereign medical order]] chartered by the [[Vekllei|Commonwealth]] in 2019, dedicated to providing emergency healthcare in the world's most dangerous and neglected regions. Members take perpetual vows of poverty, service to the suffering and Commonwealth humanitarian principles, operating where conventional medical organisations cannot or will not maintain presence.

The levy maintains a central priory in [[Helena]] and twelve mission houses across Commonwealth republics that serve as training centres, logistics hubs and rest facilities between deployments. Unlike traditional hospitals or clinics, the levy operates no permanent overseas facilities, instead deploying mobile medical teams to conflict zones, epidemic outbreaks, natural disasters and failed states. Teams work from tents, requisitioned buildings or whatever space available, often under fire or during active disease transmission.

Members specialise in trauma surgery, tropical medicine, epidemic response and austere medical practice. Training emphasises improvisation and survival alongside clinical skills. Between deployments, members live communally in mission houses with no personal possessions beyond clothes and professional equipment. Deployment cycles typically span 3-8 months in crisis zones followed by brief rest periods.

The levy lost 47 members between 2019-2064 to violence, disease and accidents in the field. Commonwealth maintains a memorial garden in [[Comet]] honouring fallen members, and their funerals are state occasions. Federal government provides transport via military aircraft, medical supplies through the [[Bureau of the Commons]], and diplomatic pressure for member protection, though members frequently refuse evacuation.

**Recognition and Operations**

The levy maintains treaty arrangements with 67 nations allowing operations in their territories, though legal status varies significantly. Some governments grant diplomatic immunity, others do not. Members operate regardless of legal protections.

Current major deployments include epidemic response in Central Africa, surgical services in three active war zones, disaster medicine following recent earthquakes, and mobile clinics in regions with collapsed healthcare systems.
