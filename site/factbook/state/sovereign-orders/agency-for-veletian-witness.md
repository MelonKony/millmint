<span class="fi fi-agency-for-veletian-witness fis"></span> **The Agency for Veletian Witness** is a [[sovereign orders|sovereign order]] chartered by the [[Vekllei|Commonwealth]] in 2023, dedicated to documentation, preservation and truth-telling in circumstances where knowledge faces destruction. Members take perpetual vows of poverty, witness to truth and Commonwealth commitment to memory and justice, operating archives and maintaining educational presence in conflict zones and repressive societies.

The agency maintains a central archive in [[Oslola]] housing vast repositories of documentation, oral histories, endangered cultural materials and evidence of atrocities. Eight regional houses across Commonwealth republics serve as smaller archives and training centres. Mobile documentation teams deploy to crisis zones to record testimony, photograph evidence, preserve cultural heritage and maintain underground educational programmes.

Members include archivists, teachers, linguists, historians and photographers, often academics who found research insufficient and required active preservation work. Between deployments, members work in Commonwealth archives teaching, translating and analysing documentation. Deployments involve embedding with refugee populations, teaching in underground schools, documenting war crimes, and smuggling archives out of repressive states.

The agency has lost 12 members since founding to violence by authoritarian regimes, with several more imprisoned. Commonwealth treats fallen members as martyrs and maintains their archives. International community reaction varies between praise for documentation work and accusations of espionage. The agency continues operations regardless of political consequences.

**Recognition and Operations**

The agency operates in 38 nations with varying degrees of legal recognition. Several authoritarian governments have banned agency activities, expelled members or imprisoned them for documentation of human rights abuses.

Current major projects include genocide documentation in three regions, preservation of endangered indigenous languages, maintenance of underground libraries in repressive states, and testimony collection from conflict survivors. The central archive in [[Oslola]] houses over 40 million documents, 180,000 hours of oral testimony and extensive photographic evidence.
