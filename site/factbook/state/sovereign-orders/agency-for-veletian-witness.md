<span class="fi fi-agency-for-veletian-witness fis"></span> **The Agency for Veletian Witness** is a [[sovereign orders|sovereign order]] chartered by the [[Vekllei|Commonwealth]] in 2023. It exists to document and preserve knowledge in places where that knowledge faces destruction. Members take vows of poverty, truth and memory, and work as archivists and teachers in conflict zones and repressive societies.

The work is dangerous and sometimes fatal. The agency has lost 12 members to violence since its founding, with several more imprisoned by authoritarian governments. The Commonwealth treats the dead as martyrs and maintains their archives. Foreign governments either praise the documentation work or denounce the agency as a front for espionage, but the work continues regardless.

The agency maintains a central archive in [[Oslola]] that houses vast repositories of documentation, oral histories, endangered cultural materials and evidence of atrocities. Eight regional houses across Commonwealth republics serve as smaller archives and training centres. Mobile documentation teams deploy to crisis zones to record testimony, photograph evidence, preserve cultural heritage and run underground educational programmes where official schooling has collapsed or been weaponised.

Members include archivists, teachers, linguists, historians and photographers. Many are academics who found research insufficient and needed to do preservation work directly. Between deployments, members work in Commonwealth archives teaching, translating and analysing documentation. Deployments mean embedding with refugee populations, teaching in underground schools, documenting war crimes and smuggling archives out of repressive states. The work requires both scholarly discipline and physical courage.

**Recognition and Operations**

The agency operates in 38 nations with varying degrees of legal recognition. Several authoritarian governments have banned agency activities, expelled members or imprisoned them for documentation of human rights abuses. The Commonwealth generally secures their release through diplomatic pressure, though not always successfully.

Current major projects include genocide documentation in three regions, preservation of endangered indigenous languages, maintenance of underground libraries in repressive states and testimony collection from conflict survivors. The central archive in [[Oslola]] houses over 40 million documents, 180,000 hours of oral testimony and extensive photographic evidence. Much of this material cannot be made public while the subjects or perpetrators remain alive.
