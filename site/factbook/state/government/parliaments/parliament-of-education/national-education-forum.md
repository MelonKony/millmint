The <span class="fi fi-nef fis"></span> **National Education Forum** is an industry organisation that represents teachers and educators in [[Vekllei]]. It administers an annual conference each October, which provides recommendations to the [[cqc|Curriculum & Qualifications Council]] on changes to the Vekllei curriculum.

It is independent of the [[Parliament of Education]] and [[Government]] and serves as a professional association for Vekllei teachers of all kinds. To this end, it also independently monitors working conditions and education standards in Vekllei schools.
