<span class="fi fi-cqc fis"></span> **Commonwealth Curriculum & Qualifications Council** (CQC, colloquially *Quick*) develops and regulates the [[Vekllei]] national curriculum and the Standard Exam. The organisation is headquartered in [[Antigua]] but has offices in most Education Regions.

The CQC is politically independent of the [[Parliament of Education]] and [[Government]], and draws on the expertise of Vekllei educators through the [[nef|National Education Forum]] to develop the national curriculum. It is updated each year, and Commonwealth schools are free to interpret its outlines independently as long as the requirements of each unit are met.
