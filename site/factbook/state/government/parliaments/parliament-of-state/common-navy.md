The <span class="fi fi-common-navy fis"></span> **Common Navy**, commonly referred to as the **White Fleet** or **Peace Fleet**, is a humanitarian naval service of the [[Vekllei]]. It enjoys the privileges and independence of a military service and it retains the naval uniforms, ranks and conventions of the military [[marine|Marine Services]], but is a seperate service under command of the [[Parliament of State]]. It maintains an independent naval tradition, command, procurement system and right of commission. In 2058, it launched the CCNV Angel of Mercy, its first dedicated aircraft carrier that replaced an older carrier renovated from military service.

Where the Commonwealth Navy serves the defence of the state, the Common Navy serves its conscience, and has a mandate of compassion, mercy and international solidarity. The mission of its fleet is to sail on invitation to domestic and foreign ports to provide relief to places suffering from disaster and war, and otherwise to deliver technical education, medical training, food and supplies to where they are needed. As a navy of the [[Vekllei]] state, it is also a display of goodwill and a substantial contributor to Commonwealth soft power in the developing world. The navy is stationed in [[ns-antigua|Naval Station Antigua]] in [[Antigua]], which is also its home port.
