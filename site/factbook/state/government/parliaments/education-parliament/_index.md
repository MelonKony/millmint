The Parliament of Health is led by the State Secretary of Education, who is a member of the [[Cabinet]]. It is represented in the [[council|Commonwealth Council]] by the First Secretary of Education.

[[Education]] is a national priority, and has been since independence. It is generally regarded as well-equipped, equitable and world-class. Innovations inside and outside the classroom have led a quiet revolution in the style and outcomes of their learning, and equip Vekllei people to meet the needs of their high-skill society. It is publicly valued and culturally cherished, and is among the foremost achievements of the 4th Commonwealth.

Because of its transformative systems of learning and reliable public investment, Vekllei schools have a high and unique reputation around the world -- praised not for their test scores, but for the quality, competence and wellbeing of the graduates it produces.
