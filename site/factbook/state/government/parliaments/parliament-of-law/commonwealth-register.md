The <span class="fi fi-c-law fis"></span> **Commonwealth Register** is a professional editorial office of the [[Parliament of Law]] responsible for consolidating and clarifying [[constitution|federal]] legislation in a transparent and democratic fashion. It operates independently from both parliament and the judiciary, staffed by appointed legal editors, linguists and specialists in plain language who serve seven-year terms and are appointed by the Parliament of Law.

The Register's primary role is to transform the accumulated mass of democratic lawmaking into organised, accessible legal codes. Under the *Commonwealth Administration Act* (2062), the Register continuously integrates new laws into consolidated codes, eliminates contradictions between statutes, removes obsolete provisions and rewrites complex legal language for public comprehension.[^authority]

The Register maintains three parallel legal frameworks: 
1. **Active Legislation** comprising laws in their original parliamentary form,
2. **Registered Codes** representing consolidated and clarified versions, and
3. **Citizen Guides** providing plain-language explanations of legal obligations and rights.

The Register's independence was tested during the Consolidation Crisis of 2031, when the [[kalina|Kalina Commonwealth]] challenged the Register's interpretation of fishing rights statutes. The crisis revealed gaps in oversight mechanisms and led to more democratic safeguards, including mandatory republic consultation periods and expanded referendum authority over Register interpretations.[^crisis]

Any republic assembly, [[constituents|Regional Commonwealth]] or citizen petition can challenge Register consolidations and demand restoration of original legislative language. The quarterly referendum system provides ultimate oversight, allowing citizens to override Register interpretations through direct democratic participation. Most of the work of the Register is fairly procedural, and its work has yet to be put to referendum.

[^authority]: The Register holds no authority to alter legal meaning or create new law, only to reorganise and clarify existing statutory language approved through democratic processes.

[^crisis]: The crisis resulted in temporary suspension of fishing law consolidations and establishment of the current consultation protocol, requiring 60-day review periods for consolidations affecting republic-specific legislation.
