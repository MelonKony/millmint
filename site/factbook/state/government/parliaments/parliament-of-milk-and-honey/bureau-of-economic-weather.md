The <span class="fi fi-bureau-of-economic-weather fis"></span> **Bureau of Economic Weather** is a bureau of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]] that treats economic disruptions as phenomena to be predicted and prepared for rather than prevented. Drawing an overt metaphor with meteorological forecasting, the bureau maps resource flows, production patterns and distribution networks across [[Vekllei]]'s scattered republics to identify emerging economic disturbances before they affect communities. Their primary aim is stability, and the bureau will advise against economic growth factors if they risk the security of the broader economy.

The bureau's approach recognises that in a moneyless economy spanning dozens of island republics, economic disruptions follow patterns similar to weather systems - they build gradually, move across regions and can be tracked using sophisticated monitoring. A shortage of manufactured goods might begin in [[Oslola]]'s industrial districts and ripple outward through the transportation network, while agricultural disruptions in [[Verde]] could create food supply pressures that affect distant republics weeks later.

This meteorological approach to economic management reflects Vekllei's unique challenges as an archipelagic nation where traditional market signals are obscured by layers of economic systems that coordinate resource allocation. Instead of straightforward price mechanisms indicating scarcity, the bureau uses pattern recognition and flow analysis to anticipate where communities might experience shortages or surpluses, allowing proactive rather than reactive economic coordination.
