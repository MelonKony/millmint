The <span class="fi fi-bureau-of-industrial-coordination fis"></span> **Bureau of Industrial Coordination** is a bureau of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]] that serves as the central office connecting Vekllei's diverse industrial [[bureaus]]. Rather than operating industries directly, it facilitates collaboration between autonomous bureaus while promoting workplace democracy and cooperative enterprise across the Commonwealth's scattered manufacturing centres.

The bureau addresses a fundamental coordination challenge in Vekllei's decentralised economy -- how to achieve industrial efficiency without conventional centralised command of industry. With major industrial centres spread across islands from [[Oslola]] to [[Kairi]], and smaller manufacturing operations scattered throughout the archipelagos, the bureau creates networks that allow autonomous industrial federations (known in Vekllei as [[bureaus]]) to share resources, coordinate production schedules and develop common technical standards.

This coordination becomes particularly complex given Vekllei's commitment to workplace democracy, where many technical production decisions emerge from worker assemblies rather than managerial hierarchies. The bureau supports this democratic industrial model by developing tools and training that help workers participate effectively in technical decision-making while supporting the productive corporate administration necessary for complex modern manufacturing. The result is a standardised system -- Vekllei factories almost exclusively use common specifications for products and production.
