The <span class="fi fi-bureau-of-economic-participation fis"></span> **Bureau of Economic Participation** is a bureau of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]] that addresses one of the fundamental challenges of Vekllei's moneyless economy: how to create meaningful work for everyone when traditional employment incentives don't exist. The bureau develops pathways for economic engagement that accommodate diverse abilities, circumstances and geographic locations across the Commonwealth's scattered island republics.

In Vekllei's [[commons]] system, economic participation extends far beyond conventional employment to include community contribution, care work, creative endeavours and local production. The bureau coordinates these diverse forms of participation while providing particular support for disabled people and rural communities who might otherwise be excluded from economic life. This work becomes especially complex across Vekllei's geographic spread, where economic opportunities vary dramatically between industrial centres like [[Oslola]] and remote agricultural islands.

The bureau operates on the principle that everyone has valuable contributions to make, but may require different forms of support or accommodation to participate fully. Rather than fitting people into existing economic structures, it works to adapt economic participation to match individual capabilities and community needs. This reflects Vekllei's broader commitment to social inclusion within its cooperative economic framework. The Bureau works from a local justification, and recognises that work considered unproductive or peripheral in a national context may provide intangible benefits to a community.
