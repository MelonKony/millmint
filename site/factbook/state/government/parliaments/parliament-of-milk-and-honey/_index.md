The Commonwealth Parliament of Milk and Honey is a [superior ministry](/parliaments/) of the [[Vekllei]] [[Government]]. It is led by a First Secretary, who reports directly to the [[Cabinet]]. Named for the biblical promise of abundance, the Parliament operates as the conductor of Vekllei's productive machinery ‚Äî coordinating a complex symphony of production, distribution and consumption that services a dignified standard of living without markets or money.

While ministries handle sectoral administration, the Bureau of Milk and Honey thinks in terms of flows, rhythms and processes across the entire Commonwealth economy. This process is both technically procedural and an art, orchestrating the tempo of production seasons, the regional specialisations that create diversity within unity and the careful balance between work and toil that keeps Vekllei's social economy vibrant.

The Parliament's approach reflects the principle that economic life should serve human dignity rather than abstract efficiency. It recognises that work itself possesses inherent value when it contributes to the common good, and that genuine abundance means ensuring everyone can participate meaningfully in productive life. The Parliament coordinates not just the production of goods but the creation of conditions where work becomes a form of social participation rather than mere survival.

Broadly, the responsibilities of the Parliament of Milk and Honey include:

{{<note>}}
* Coordination of productive life that honours human dignity.
* Oversight of workplace arrangements that promote labour participation and social solidarity.
* Orchestration of production rhythms and seasonal economic cycles across the Commonwealth.
* Coordination of inter-republic specialisation and regional comparative advantages.
* Planning for economic security that enables family and community life to flourish.
* Coordination of environmental stewardship and care for the land sovereign across production.
* Administration of programmes ensuring universal access to meaningful work.
* Direction of economic development that strengthens rather than fragments communities.
* Management of the balance between human labour and automated production.
* Planning for economic resilience and stockpiles.

The Parliament of Milk and Honey is led by the State Secretary of the Commons, who is a member of the [[Cabinet]]. It is represented in the [[council|Commonwealth Council]] by the First Secretary of Milk and Honey.

Production orchestration is managed through the [[Bureau of Industrial Coordination]], which coordinates the complex rhythms of Commonwealth-wide production without centralised control.

As the conductor of Vekllei's material standard of living, the Parliament demonstrates that conscious orchestration can supplement both markets and central planning. Through careful attention to economic rhythms, demand, supply and logistics, it is a substantial contributor to the quality of their lives.
