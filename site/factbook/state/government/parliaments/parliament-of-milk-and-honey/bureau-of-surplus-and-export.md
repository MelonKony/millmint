The <span class="fi fi-bureau-of-surplus-and-export fis"></span> **Bureau of Surplus and Export** is a bureau of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]] that regulates the transition between Vekllei's moneyless domestic economy and foreign markets. When production exceeds what the *commons* can absorb, the bureau licenses surplus goods for international export, creating a controlled gateway between domestic abundance and foreign exchange.

This system operates on the principle that meeting domestic demand takes priority over export opportunity. Producers must first demonstrate their goods have saturated local and commonwealth-wide demand before receiving export licenses. This creates an incentive structure where successful domestic production earns the privilege of international market access, rewarding productivity while ensuring domestic self-sufficiency -- the basis of Vekllei's quality of life -- remains paramount.

Export licensing generates benefits that cannot be directly monetised within the commons but provide tangible advantages to successful producers. These include priority access to imported materials, petty luxuries (fine foreign wines; cigars; produce for barter and trade), preferential allocation of industrial equipment, enhanced transportation rights and recognition through the Commonwealth Merit System. Such rewards maintain productive incentives while respecting the moneyless character of domestic society.

The bureau also coordinates with foreign aid programmes that channel surplus production to developing nations, particularly within the nonaligned movement. This serves both humanitarian goals and diplomatic objectives, using Vekllei's productive capacity to build international relationships while disposing of excess goods constructively.
