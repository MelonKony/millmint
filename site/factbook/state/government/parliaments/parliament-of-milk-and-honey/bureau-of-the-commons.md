The <span class="fi fi-bureau-of-the-commons fis"></span> **Bureau of the Commons** is a bureau of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]] that operates as Vekllei's circulatory system, moving goods between the Commonwealth's 83 republics without the coordinating mechanism of prices. In a moneyless economy spread across thousands of kilometres of ocean, the bureau must track what each community produces, what it needs and how to move resources efficiently between islands that may be separated by vast distances and different time zones.

The scale of this logistical challenge becomes apparent when considering specific flows: fresh fish from [[Summers]]'s fishing fleets must reach [[Oslola]]'s population centres before spoiling, while manufactured electronics from [[Kairi]]'s factories need distribution across dozens of smaller island republics with varying transportation links. The bureau coordinates these movements through sophisticated inventory systems that track production, consumption and transportation capacity across the entire archipelagic nation.

This coordination requires the bureau to function simultaneously as shipping company, warehouse network and allocation authority. Without market prices to indicate where goods are most needed, the bureau must develop alternative methods for determining distribution priorities -- balancing immediate needs, seasonal variations, transport efficiency and community preferences while maintaining the principle that essential goods should reach everyone regardless of their island's size or economic output.
