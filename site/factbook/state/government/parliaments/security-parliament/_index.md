### Public Security Directorate

The *Public Security Directorate* (Cosevac, or POSEC) is primarily tasked with intelligence related to public security, and is closely linked to the domestic intelligence-gathering activities of [HO/NI](#home-office-honi). POSEC is a directorate that primarily services the interests of the public, which distinguishes it from [National Intelligence](#national-intelligence-directorate) amd [SESEC](#state-security-directorate). To this end, it coordinates closely with the [[Police of the Parliament]] to conduct operations against terrorism, smuggling, organised crime and civil unrest.

### State Security Directorate

The *State Security Directorate* (Vosevisi, or SESEC) is primarily responsible for the security of the state itself, including all Vekllei parliaments, its ministries, secretariats and features, and its civil service and employees. It monitors, investigates and eliminates threats within and without the [Vekllei Government](/factbook/society/state/government/) and [Palace](/factbook/society/state/palace/), and controls privileged information of the Vekllei parliaments.

SESEC works closely with the [Home Office of National Intelligence](#home-office-honi), the National Intelligence Directorate organ responsible for the internal security of Vekllei's intelligence network. In cases of internal breaches of security, the SESEC acts as investigator and prosecutor. It includes the following departments.

* **General Office**: SESEC administration.
* **OPG Bureau**: Operational guidance section responsible for coordination of SESEC offices.
* **COMSEC Bureau**: Management of confidential communications.
* **DOCSEC Bureau**: Document archive and imaging intelligence section.
* **CONSEC Bureau**: Counterintelligence section seperate from NI.
* **INTSEC Bureau**: Internal security and monitoring of infiltration by domestic and international threats.

#### State Secrets Office

The *State Secrets Office* is responsible for the protection of classified information. It maintains a control network of security classifications, and is charged with the location and security of classified documents. It also advises and processes changes to classifications, particularly in the case of state (as opposed to military) intelligence.

* **1st Control Authority *Most Secret*** -- Information that would gravely damage the Commonwealth.
* **2nd Control Authority *Secret*** -- Information that would seriously damage the Commonwealth.
* **3rd Control Authority *Confidential*** -- Information that would damage the Commonwealth.
* **4th Control Authority *Restrict*** -- Information of significant danger to individuals or Commonwealth activities.
