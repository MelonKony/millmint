The <span class="fi fi-c-foreign-affairs fis"></span> **Bureau of Travel** organises [travel abroad](/bulletin/travel) for [[Vekllei]] people and facilitates travel and accomodation for foreign visitors to the country. Unlike a conventional tourism promotion agency, the primary function of the Bureau of Travel is to assist overseas travel for Vekllei people, since they generally cannot finance themselves in the [[commons]]. The Bureau of Travel, through its constituent corporation [[Atlantic Hotel]], operates a network of hotels throughout the world for the use of Vekllei citizens. It also undertakes extensive contract work with local tourism agencies to organise tours, tickets, expeditions and events to minimise the use of cash by Vekllei people.

The other role of the Bureau is facilitating international travel to Vekllei, which remains a small but growing market. Since foreign tourists do not use money while in Vekllei, tourism is typically arranged in package tours through the [[Atlantic Hotel]] chain. In this capacity is also serves as a tourism promotion board, and develops interest in travel to Vekllei overseas.
