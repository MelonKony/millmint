The <span class="fi fi-c-commonwealth fis"></span> **Bureau of Commonwealth Corporations** is a bureau of the [[Ministry of the Commonwealth]] responsible for coordinating government-owned enterprises, devolved commercial activities and overseeing government commerce and industrial governance across [[Vekllei]]. The bureau serves as the central coordinating body for all government-owned corporations and commercial enterprises under federal authority.

Government corporations are typically subordinated to their relevant ministries, and the Bureau has no direct oversight over their management or operation. The Bureau instead bestows legal entitlements to government departments for ownership and use of a corporation, and monitors performance, joint ventures between ministries and governance standards for government enterprises. It also manages the Commonwealth's strategic investments and facilitates commercial cooperation between different government sectors.
