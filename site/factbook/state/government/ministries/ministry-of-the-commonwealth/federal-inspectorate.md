The <span class="fi fi-c-commonwealth fis"></span> **Federal Inspectorate** is a constituent body of the [[Ministry of the Commonwealth]] responsible for conducting independent inspections, audits and compliance reviews across all federal and republic government operations in [[Vekllei]]. The Inspectorate serves as the Commonwealth's internal oversight mechanism, ensuring ministries and public offices maintain standards while identifying inefficiencies and recommending improvements.

The Inspectorate operates with substantial autonomy from the ministries it inspects, reporting directly to the Commonwealth Directory and Parliament. Inspectors possess broad authority to access facilities, review records and interview staff across all government operations. Unlike criminal investigations conducted by the [[Parliament of Law]], the Inspectorate focuses on administrative compliance, operational efficiency and standards adherence.

Inspection teams are organised by ministry sector, with specialised inspectors trained in the technical requirements of each domain. A typical inspection might examine workplace safety standards, procurement practices, resource allocation efficiency or service delivery quality. The Inspectorate publishes quarterly reports identifying systemic issues and tracking ministry responses to recommendations.
