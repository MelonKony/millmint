The <span class="fi fi-air-service fis"></span> **Air Service** conducts aerial warfare in [[Vekllei]] as part of the [[Ministry of Defence]]. It consists of three commands that specialise in different aspects of air support and supremacy. The Air Service is also a major contributor to other services, since marine and territorial doctrines depend heavily on the air service for their combat capability, combat support, transport, logistics and reconnaissance.

Vekllei has a rapid air-mobile posture across its armed forces, which is facilitated by the relative size and availability of its air service. It is also the only service in which women are a majority of participants in combat, since female pilots contribute just over 52% of its servicemen.

*Structure*

There are three commands in the Air Service, which in the secular Vekllei tradition have specific and exclusive functions. The Air Combat Command comprises all primary offensive squadrons including fighters, helicopters and scouts. The Air Auxiliary Command comprises miscellaneous aviation including search and rescue, training and replenishment. The Air Transport Command provides transport for both logistics and combat organisations.

Vekllei aircraft are primarily designed and manufactured domestically, and use mostly nuclear propulsion. Efforts to streamline and simplify inventory in recent years have reduced the overall types of aircraft in service.
