The <span class="fi fi-noshem fis"></span> **Commonwealth Intelligence Service** (*National Intelligence*, or *Noshem*) is the secret service of [[Vekllei]] and the Commonwealth's primary covert intelligence apparatus abroad. It is concerned with intelligence gathering, surveillance and operations external to the Commonwealth, operating through 40 semiautonomous sections organised into six regional bureaus.

Noshem's sophisticated intelligence network and broad mandate contribute to its reputation abroad, and conspiracies about its presence exist in almost every country. The service is unique in its recruitment of foreigners, many of whom are promised citizenship and residency in Vekllei. Many Noshem sections recruit locally and manage foreign assets through Vekllei-born supervisors.

The service operates under direction of the [[Security Parliament]] and reports to the [[directory|Commonwealth Directory]]. Its operations range from conventional intelligence gathering to covert action, counter-espionage and support for democratic movements abroad. Noshem maintains close but informal relationships with various non-state actors including labour movements, independence organisations and dissident groups across multiple continents.

## Structure

**Department of Analysis** coordinates intelligence assessment and policy recommendations. The Office of General Policy provides strategic guidance whilst the Office of Threat Assessment evaluates security risks to Commonwealth interests.

**Department of Espionage** manages counter-intelligence operations through the General Office of Counter-Espionage and conducts risk mitigation for Commonwealth personnel and facilities abroad.

**Department of Intelligence Sections** oversees the 40 operational sections through the Sections Council, provides training through the General Training Section and coordinates activities through the Office of Section Coordination.

**Department of Finance** handles operational funding, payments to foreign assets and financial intelligence through the General Office of Accounts & Payments.

**Department of Control Authority** manages information security through the Office of Secrets, maintains operational security through the Office of Personnel & Culture, coordinates with Commonwealth media through the Office of the Intelligence Press and exercises oversight through the Office of Control Authority.

**Department of Government Intelligence** liaises with military and civilian leadership through dedicated offices serving the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]], Security Cabinet and Security Parliament.
