The <span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Maritime Service** (the traditional **Navy** or *Navy of the Public*) is the traditional naval warfare component of the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] of [[Vekllei]] as part of the [[Ministry of Defence]]. It consists of surface ships and submarines that form the backbone of Vekllei's strategic naval power. The Maritime Service comprises three operational fleets and an auxiliary service that functions similarly to a republican or federal militia.

As a seagoing country of island communities, the Maritime Service represents the historic and contemporary primary means of defence for Vekllei. All surface vessels and submarines operate under unified naval command, working closely with other services to provide integrated maritime defence across the Commonwealth's vast oceanic territories.

The Maritime Service operates four distinct fleet commands, each specialised for different operational theatres and strategic requirements. The Commonwealth Fleet serves as the primary naval force, while the Arctic and Antarctic Fleets provide polar operational capability. The Home Fleet functions as both a ceremonial and operational auxiliary force distributed across Vekllei's 78 republics.

**Commonwealth Fleet**

The *Commonwealth Fleet* (Sovereign/Federal Fleet) is the largest naval formation in Vekllei and is tasked with defence of the country's central corridor, a triangular area with points in [[Oslola]], [[Costa Verde]] and [[Summers]]. It represents the primary striking force of the Maritime Service.

**Home Fleet (Auxiliary)**

The *Home Fleet* (Auxiliary Fleet) is an auxiliary fleet stationed across the 78 island city-states that make up the country. Each Vekllei republic serves as home port to a particular frigate. While they serve a ceremonial role, they are active warships that perform littoral maritime security duties and can be federalised into other fleets as necessary.

The Maritime Service operates from a network of naval stations that provide facilities to dock, refurbish and construct vessels. Major naval stations include [[NS Kairi]] (the largest), [[NS Oslola]], [[NS Falklands]], [[NS Antigua]], and [[NS Verde]]. These stations often incorporate other military functions such as air bases, training centres, radar stations and research facilities.

Maritime vessels are primarily designed and manufactured domestically, with emphasis on nuclear propulsion for major combatants and advanced electronics for command and control. The service maintains high readiness levels across all fleets to respond to threats across Vekllei's vast oceanic territories.
