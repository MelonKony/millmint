The <span class="fi fi-littoral-service fis"></span> **Littoral Service** (the *Coast Guard* or *Navy of the Parliament*) is the maritime security component of the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] of [[Vekllei]] as part of the [[Ministry of Defence]]. It provides customs, policing and search and rescue services for Vekllei's territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, though it frequently patrols international waters in the Atlantic. The service plays a crucial role in maintaining maritime security across the Commonwealth's vast oceanic territories.

The Littoral Service operates with a broad mandate that encompasses law enforcement, search and rescue, customs enforcement, environmental protection, and border security. As Vekllei spans the entirety of the Atlantic and Caribbean seas, the service maintains one of the world's largest maritime patrol areas and exclusive economic zones.

The Littoral Service operates through 12 regional commands across the Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic and Caribbean Oceans, covering the entirety of Vekllei's exclusive economic zone and territorial waters. Each command is tailored to the specific geographic and operational challenges of its region, from Arctic icebreaking operations to Caribbean anti-narcotics patrols.
