The <span class="fi fi-c-light-and-water fis"></span> **Commonwealth Water Commission** (commonly *Hydroburo*) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services across [[Vekllei]]. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.

In [[Oslola]] and [[Kala]], most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.
