The **Commonwealth Employment Register** (CER) is a functional body of the [[Ministry of Labour]] that records occupations of Vekllei citizens. Since Vekllei people have a legal obligation to be occupied in some capacity, a term which includes education and housework, the CER maintains a database of registered occupations that ensures compliance and provides useful economic data to the [[Government]] of [[Vekllei]]. In this sense, the CER has a close relationship with the [[Bureau of Statistics]].

The CER serves only an administrative and clerical role, and does not submit policy or provide enforcement for legal obligations. Although it is a useful resource of the Labour Ministry, it primarily facilitates self-reporting from Vekllei citizens. It is headquartered in [[Virgin]], but is networked with identical databases in [[Oslola]].
