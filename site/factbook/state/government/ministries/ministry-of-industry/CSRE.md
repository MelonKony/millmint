The <span class="fi fi-csre fis"></span> **Commonwealth Computer Science Research Establishment** (CSRE) is a research organisation of the [[Ministry of Industry]]. It is a part of [[SIRO]] and is the primary government computing research organisation in [[Vekllei]]. The establishment has approximately 8,000 employees across laboratories, testing facilities and manufacturing research complexes throughout the Commonwealth.

The CSRE emerged from the Twin Electric research programme with the United Kingdom in the 2010s, initially focused on adapting British holographic memory systems for Vekllei applications. It has extensive connections throughout the Commonwealth computing industry and regularly collaborates with commercial manufacturers including [[National Machines]] and Votraitey Electrics. The establishment is a major contributor to Vekllei technology and several CSRE inventions have become essential to daily life, including the [[photovolumes|photovolume]] archive system and the National Bulletin System.

## Boards & Commissions
* <span class="fi fi-csre fis"></span> **CSRE Industral Automatics Board**: Partner representatives from commercial computer manufacturers and major users of automatic systems for public-private research coordination in conjunction with the [[Bureau of Automatics]].
* <span class="fi fi-csre fis"></span> **Commonwealth Computing Systems Commission**: Development of technical standards for optical computers, data formats and system interoperability.
* <span class="fi fi-csre fis"></span> **National Photonic Research Council**: Coordination of fundamental photonics research across universities, particularly at Vekllei National University's National Photonic Laboratories.
* <span class="fi fi-csre fis"></span> **Automatic Systems Advisory Board**: Technical consultation on robot control systems for the [[Bureau of Automation and Robotics]].
