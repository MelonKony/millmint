The <span class="fi fi-c-industry fis"></span> **Bureau of Hydrocarbons** is a bureau of the [[Ministry of Industry]] responsible for hydrocarbon resource management across Vekllei's extensive maritime territories. Despite broad adoption of nuclear energy for commercial, industrial and some transportation purposes, petroleum and natural gas remain essential for non-nuclearised transport, plastics manufacturing and chemical feedstocks. The bureau coordinates extraction from offshore platforms, oversees refining facilities and manages strategic reserves distributed across island republics.

The geographic dispersal of Vekllei's territories creates unique challenges for hydrocarbon infrastructure. Major refineries operate in [[Curacao]], [[Kairi]] and [[Hetland]], processing crude oil from Commonwealth offshore fields and occasional imports. The bureau must balance local refining capacity against transportation costs, maintaining fuel depots on smaller islands while avoiding redundant infrastructure. Regional fuel security becomes particularly critical during hurricane season in the Caribbean or winter storms affecting Arctic territories.

Beyond extraction and distribution, the bureau manages the Commonwealth's transition away from hydrocarbon dependence. This includes oversight of synthetic fuel research, coordination with [[NSRE]] on nuclear alternatives and gradual reduction of petroleum use where practical substitutes exist. The work requires balancing immediate energy needs against long-term environmental commitments, a tension that plays out differently across republics with varying industrial profiles and natural resources.
