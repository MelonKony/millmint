The <span class="fi fi-c-industry fis"></span> **Bureau of Automatics** is a bureau of the [[Ministry of Industry]] responsible for [[robots]] in [[Vekllei]], including coordinating automated production systems, establishing robotics standards and managing the expansion of automatic machinery across the Commonwealth. The bureau serves as the central authority for industrial automation policy, working closely with the [[CSRE]] on industrial robotics and [[SIRO]] on automation research.

Automation in Vekllei operates through centralised [[computers|optical computer]] systems called Automatic Asset Commands, which control fleets of mobile robots via radio transmission. These droids perform repetitive industrial tasks, logistics operations and auxiliary public service functions across the Commonwealth. The bureau maintains the technical standards that allow different automatic systems to communicate and coordinate, preventing the fragmentation of automation infrastructure across 83 republics.

The bureau does not manufacture robots or automatic systems directly. Instead it certifies designs, allocates radio frequencies for robot control, maintains the registry of Automatic Asset Commands and coordinates automation deployment to prevent redundancy or gaps in coverage. It also manages the social transition to automated production by identifying roles suitable for automation and coordinating with the [[Ministry of Labour]] on workforce redeployment.
