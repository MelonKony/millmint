The <span class="fi fi-commonwealth-industrial-congress fis"></span> **Commonwealth Industrial Congress** is an autonomous body of the [[Ministry of Industry]] responsible for large-scale industrial development that exceeds the capacity of individual republics or bureaus. While regular manufacturing operates through factory councils and bureau coordination, certain industrial projects require centralised planning and cooperation across [[republics]]. The Congress aids construction of major factories, coordination of supply chains spanning multiple islands, development of new industrial centres in smaller republics and strategic decisions about industrial capacity allocation across the Commonwealth. It has a close relationship with the economic regulators of the [[Parliament of Milk and Honey]], but has a specific technical role as a functionary of industry and is consequently a cosntituent of the [[Ministry of Industry]]. 

The congress's work becomes necessary when industrial logic conflicts with local autonomy. A steel mill might serve a dozen republics but can only be built in one location -- and its construction can attract lucrative federal investment. The congress negotiates these placements, balances regional industrial development and manages the political tensions that arise when economic efficiency suggests centralising production in already-developed islands like [[Oslola]] or [[Kairi]] while equity demands spreading industry across the Commonwealth. This includes determining when smaller republics should develop local manufacturing versus relying on imports from industrial centres.

Strategic industrial capacity represents another core responsibility. The congress maintains reserve production facilities that normally operate at reduced capacity but can expand during crises, manages critical supply chains that cannot be interrupted and coordinates industrial mobilisation during emergencies. This proved essential during the 2061 Congo Crisis when the congress rapidly expanded munitions production and organised supply shipments. The work requires balancing peacetime efficiency against the need for industrial resilience and rapid expansion capability.

## Divisions

* <span class="fi fi-commonwealth-industrial-congress fis"></span> **Central Industrial Council**: Planning and construction of major industrial facilities requiring multi-republic coordination. Manages relationships between factory locations and affected communities.
* <span class="fi fi-commonwealth-industrial-congress fis"></span> **Strategic Reserve Council**: Maintenance of reserve production facilities and coordination of industrial expansion during emergencies. Works closely with [[Ministry of Defence]] on mobilisation planning.
* <span class="fi fi-commonwealth-industrial-congress fis"></span> **Regional Industrial Council**: Coordination of industrial development across different commonwealth regions. Facilitates technology transfer and expertise sharing between developed and developing industrial centres.
* <span class="fi fi-commonwealth-industrial-congress fis"></span> **Industrial Supply Council**: Management of complex supply chains spanning multiple republics and production stages. Identifies vulnerabilities and develops redundant capacity for critical materials. Hosts representatives from the [[Bureau of Materials and Supply]]

## Regional Sections

* **Polar Atlantic Section**: Industrial coordination across [[Oslola]], [[Kala]], Arctic territories and [[Antarctic]] island groups.
* **Caribbean Section**: Industrial development in [[Kalina]], [[Antilles]] and [[Lucaya]] commonwealths.
* **Verde Section**: Industrial capacity building across [[Verde]] and African Atlantic territories.
* **Special Projects Section**: Major industrial developments requiring exceptional coordination or unique technical challenges.
