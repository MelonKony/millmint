The <span class="fi fi-c-industry fis"></span> **Bureau of Production Surveillance** is a bureau of the [[Ministry of Industry]] that tracks what the Commonwealth produces, how efficiently factories operate and whether output meets quality standards. In a [[commons|moneyless economy]] without price signals to indicate productive efficiency, the bureau has to develop alternative metrics for assessing industrial performance. This surveillance extends across everything from automated lots producing electronics to small workshop cooperatives crafting furniture.

The bureau's work differs fundamentally from capitalist quality control because it operates without profit incentives. Rather than maximizing output per worker or minimizing costs, surveillance focuses on whether production serves community needs, operates sustainably and maintains acceptable quality standards. A factory running at 60% capacity might be performing perfectly if demand has been satisfied, while another at 90% capacity could be wasteful if producing unwanted goods. The bureau must distinguish between genuine inefficiency and the natural variation of an economy organised around use rather than exchange.

This monitoring extends beyond individual facilities to track industrial patterns across republics and sectors. The bureau identifies bottlenecks where production lags behind demand, oversupply situations where factories produce more than communities need, and quality issues requiring intervention. Regional disparities receive particular attention, so smaller island republics receive adequate manufactured goods despite limited local production capacity. The data feeds back into planning processes, helping the [[Bureau of Industrial Coordination]] adjust production priorities.
