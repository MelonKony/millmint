The <span class="fi fi-transport-commission fis"></span> **Commonwealth Transport Commission** manages public transport in [[Vekllei]]. While operation is delegated to many federated companies operated by the government and individual licensees, including [[CommRail]], [[Commonwealth Airways]] and [[Commonwealth Lines]] the transport commission is responsible for the overall connectivity and usefulness of the network.

Most Vekllei people do not own private automobiles and so cannot be expected to travel via their own means. Instead, transport has to be arranged through useful and well-maintained public services, which the transport commission arranges. It is headquartered in Praya in [[Aruba]].

The Transport Commission's findings are non-binding but generally respected, and the commission has access to real-time data provided by networked industrial computers. It also makes recommendations to the Vekllei [[Cabinet]]. The fundamental aim of the commission is to facilitate the accessibility of any Vekllei person to any part of Vekllei via the public networks it is famous for.
