The <span class="fi fi-c-commons fis"></span> **Bureau of Housing** plans, constructs and improves municipalised and public housing in [[Vekllei]]. [Housing in Vekllei](/housing/) is negotiated, purchased and leased at a municipal level, and so most new homes are designed and constructed by the civil service through architects and construction agents. The Bureau of Housing coordinates this process at different levels, and also receives maintenance requests and complaints as a regulatory body.

The Bureau of Housing may represent the public in court proceedings over ownership. It also employs [investigators](/stories/inspectors/) to determine stewardship of land and its current use. The bureau is also partly responsible for integration of migrant communities into Vekllei cities, by mixing cultural groups through programmes designed to incentivise multicultural neighbourhoods.
