The <span class="fi fi-c-commons fis"></span> **Bureau of Rail** maintains and regulates the rail industry in Vekllei. Because of the ubiquity and importance of rail across [[Vekllei]] [republics](/republics), it is among the largest of the transport bureaus.

In addition to rail planning, safety and regulation, the bureau also controls [[CommRail]] as an independent commission, for which it fulfils a general executive and advisory role.

Including VNR, the Bureau of Rail is consequently one of the largest rail transport organisations in the world, rivalling much larger countries with the density and ubiquity of Vekllei track. Almost every Vekllei republic maintains some kind of rail service, ranging from miniature trams and industrial sidings to bullet trains and maglevs.
