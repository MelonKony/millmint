The <span class="fi fi-nhs fis"></span> **Atlantic History Federation** is a cultural federation and research institution associated with the [[Ministry of Culture]] responsible for promoting historical research, conducting museum and collections maintenance and promoting understanding of [[Vekllei]]'s cultural heritage.

Through its constituents, the federation represents professional historiography in Vekllei. As part of these efforts, it maintains archaeological collections and preserves historical sites throughout the Commonwealth.
