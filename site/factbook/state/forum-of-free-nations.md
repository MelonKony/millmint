The **Forum of Free Nations** (FFE, also known as the Non-Aligned Movement) is a forum of countries that are not aligned with or against a power bloc. It was founded as a reaction towards the rapid bi-polarisation of world affairs, particularly of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and advocates for independence from the superpowers of the world.
