<span class="fi fi-rosea-beverage-company fis"></span> **Rosea Beverage Company** is a lime drink manufacturer in [[Vekllei]]. Based in [[Kabuli]], it operates as a private family company producing the famous Rosea lime cordial and other citrus beverages from its original factory in Roseau.

The company was established in 1932 as Roseau Lime Works to process the abundant lime harvests of [[Kabuli]] for the British merchant fleet. The island's citrus groves supplied lime juice as an anti-scorbutic for Royal Navy vessels and commercial shipping throughout the Caribbean, a trade dating back centuries.

Rosea lime juice became famous across the Commonwealth for its distinctive tartness and refreshing quality. The original factory in Roseau was modernised in the 2040s while preserving its vintage processing equipment and traditional production methods. Local fruits including mangoes, soursop, passion fruit and breadfruit supplement the core lime cordial line.

The company remains in the hands of the founding family, now in its fourth generation of management. Rosea products are distributed throughout the [[kalina|Kalina Commonwealth]] and exported internationally, particularly to the United Kingdom where Caribbean lime drinks retain cultural significance. The company employs about 350 people seasonally across its factory operations and citrus processing facilities.
