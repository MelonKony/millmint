The <span class="fi fi-atlantic-store fis"></span> **Atlantic Department Company** S.A., trading as <span class="fi fi-atlantic-store fis"></span> **Atlantic**, is the largest mainland department store chain in [[Vekllei]]. It is among the few companies to survive the transition to the [social economy](/social-economy/) with its ownership intact, and remains within the family of the Kolot family that founded the chain in 1830.

Atlantic's flagship store is in Lonne, [[Oslola]], but has expanded in the postwar period to have stores in most populous Vekllei republics. It stocks a variety of dry goods, most commonly apparel and cosmetics but also homewares and furniture. Atlantic has a concierge system that allows longtime customers to book fittings and select a preferred attendant and tailor.

Atlantic is listed as ATL on the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|Commsec]] and is the 12th largest company listed in the [CRC/CSX 50](/ratings/). It is a preferred distributor of the Vekllei government.
