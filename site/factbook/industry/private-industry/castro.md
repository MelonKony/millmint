<span class="fi fi-castro fis"></span> **Castro** is a legendary avant-garde restaurant in [[Oslola]], widely regarded as the birthplace of scientific gastronomy in [[Vekllei]]. Founded in 2025 by chef Andreas Castro in the capital's historic Lola district, the restaurant has become synonymous with molecular gastronomy and experimental cuisine that challenges traditional notions of food preparation and presentation.

The restaurant occupies a converted 19th-century Imperial-period townhouse on Copperplate Street, where Castro transformed the basement into a fully equipped laboratory and the upper floors into an intimate 20-seat dining room. The establishment operates on a reservation system so exclusive that the only reliable way to secure a table is through the famous quarterly lottery, where golden tickets are mailed to randomly selected applicants from across the Commonwealth.

Castro's influence extends far beyond its dining room through the Castro School, an educational institution that operated intermittently between 2025 and 2045. This school trained a generation of chefs in scientific cooking techniques, creating what is now known as the Castro System -- a network of restaurants across Vekllei's republics that share a commitment to experimental gastronomy and scientific methodology.
