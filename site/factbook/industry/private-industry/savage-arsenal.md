<span class="fi fi-savage-arsenal fis"></span> **Savage Arsenal** S.c.L. is a specialist artillery manufacturer in [[Vekllei]]. Based in [[Kabuli]], it operates as a cooperative focused on lightweight mountain artillery, expeditionary guns and air-deployable weapons systems designed for the rugged terrain and dispersed operations characteristic of island defence.

The company was founded by brothers Thomas and William Savage, British expatriates who established a small foundry in Roseau in 1891 to produce naval deck guns for Caribbean coastal defence. The firm developed expertise in compact, manoeuvrable artillery suited to island fortifications and difficult terrain.

Savage Arsenal produces the GUN-40 mountain howitzer and PACK-series pack guns for the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]], alongside specialised mortars and air-portable artillery for expeditionary operations. The company pioneered modular artillery systems that can be broken down for helicopter transport and reassembled rapidly in field conditions.

The cooperative maintains close partnerships with [[Commonwealth Arsenal]] for research and development, and is a major Vekllei arms exporter. Savage Arsenal employs approximately 220 people across its Kabuli facilities and mountain testing ranges, and is listed on the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|Commsec]] as SVG.
