<span class="fi fi-spirit-glass fis"></span> **Spirit Glass** S.c.L. is the principal manufacturer of glass containers in [[Vekllei]], producing bottles and jars for the commonwealth's food, beverage, and medical supply sectors. The company was established in 1978 to modernise the country's glass production and reduce reliance on imported packaging.

The company's main business is the production of standard beverage bottles for food and beverages, followed by custom-moulded, heavier glass for premium local spirits. Spirit Glass also supplies glass jars for bureau food preservation and specific vials for the Commonwealth's medical supply chain. The company processes a large volume of recycled glass (cullet) sourced through the municipal bureau collection system, which is a key input for its operations.

Spirit Glass operates its main furnace and bottling lines at its headquarters in [[Oslola]]. A second plant in [[Summers]] focuses on speciality glass, including pharmaceutical-grade vials and high-end spirit bottles, which often require tighter tolerance and specific material formulations. The company maintains a regional distribution facility in [[Kairi]] to service northern industries.

The company employs modern, high-speed Individual Section (IS) forming machines, a method that allows it to produce high volumes of standard packaging.

Despite the inherent energy demands of glass production, Spirit Glass has maintained its market share by integrating with local raw material suppliers for silica sand and limestone. The company remains privately held by the Armes family.
