<span class="fi fi-method-heavy fis"></span> **Method Heavy Industries** (commonly *Method Heavy*) is a private industrial machinery manufacturer in [[Vekllei]] that produces specialised equipment for processing, agriculture, precision manufacturing and infrastructure. The company maintains eight major manufacturing facilities across the Commonwealth and supplies critical machinery to industries ranging from gemstone processing to pharmaceutical production.

Founded in 1928 as a workshop producing agricultural equipment in [[Oslola]], Method Heavy grew through the interwar period by developing expertise in precision machining and specialised industrial systems. Unlike many Vekllei industrial firms, Method Heavy retained its private structure through the Commonwealth period, though it operates within the [[commons]] system and maintains strong cooperative relationships with municipal enterprises.

The company's reputation rests on its ability to produce highly specialised equipment that requires both engineering precision and deep industrial knowledge. Method Heavy machines are found in critical applications across Vekllei industry, from the crystal growth furnaces that produce synthetic gemstones to the high-pressure systems that power the country's pipeline infrastructure.
