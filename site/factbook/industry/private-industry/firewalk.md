<span class="fi fi-firewalk fis"></span> **Firewalk** S.c.L. is a tyre and rubber products manufacturer in [[Vekllei]], producing tyres for bicycles, mopeds, automobiles and aircraft. Originally established as Firestone Vekllei during British occupation, the company was spun off as an independent entity during the transition to Commonwealth independence in 2022.

The company maintains technical licensing agreements with Firestone, allowing it to manufacture certain tyre designs and access research facilities in exchange for royalty payments in Government Crowns. This arrangement has proven beneficial for both parties, with Firewalk gaining established technology and Firestone retaining a presence in the Atlantic market without direct investment.

Firewalk's primary business centres on bicycle and moped tyres, which account for nearly 70% of units sold. The ubiquity of the [[gina|Gina Motoral]] created sustained demand for affordable, durable tyres suited to Vekllei's varied terrain and climate. The company's "Cloudwalk" bicycle tyre remains the most common tyre fitted to personal and municipal cyclepool bikes across the Commonwealth.

The company operates two manufacturing facilities. Its headquarters in [[Oslola]] houses the main production line and research division, whilst a smaller plant in [[Kairi]] focuses on specialty tyres for agricultural and industrial vehicles. A third facility in [[Summers]] produces aircraft tyres for Commonwealth Airways and other carriers.

Firewalk tyres are distinguished by their bright orange sidewalls on automobiles, a design choice that originated as a visibility feature for bicycle tyres but has become a signature across the product range. The company sponsors several Commonwealth cycling teams and maintains a small museum of historic tyres and rubber products at its Oslola headquarters.

Despite competition from imports, Firewalk has maintained its position through a reputation for reliability and a distribution network integrated with Vekllei's bureau system. The company remains privately held by the original management team who negotiated the spin-off, though shares are traded through the Vekllei [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|CSX]].
