<span class="fi fi-general-reactor fis"></span> **General Reactor** S.p.A. (GR or the Green Shop) is a bureau corporation that operates the majority of fission and fusion power generation in [[Vekllei]]. It comprises mostly municipal plant corporations and specialised nuclear corporations for fuels and uranium enrichment.

General Reactor is also a major manufacturer of atomic engines through its constituent corporations, and contributes substantial research and development towards Vekllei atomic projects. It has close connections with the [[NSRE]], and its Chief Scientist sits on the establishment's board. It contributed to the development of sunburst reactors used in light aircraft, as well as the Vekllei [spaceplane](/stories/lightbulb/) programme. The bureau also developed and manufactures the [*Vampire*](/NMPR/) marine propulsion system.

The company operates major fusion plants in [[Oslola]] where it is headquartered, as well as [[Kairi]]. It operates dozens more fission plants across Vekllei, as well as the infrastructure to support them.
