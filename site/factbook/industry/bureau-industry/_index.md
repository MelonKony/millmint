**Bureaus** in [[Vekllei]] are industrial syndicates of companies that represent substantial or monopoly power over an industrial market. Their existence is recognised by Vekllei economic policy as a means of furnishing a reasonable standard of living for Vekllei people outside of the anarchy of the [private markets](/finance). As a result, bureaus are concerned primarily with the public good and industrial policy. Bureaus are not state-owned, though they may count [[state-industry|state-owned corporations]] among their constituents.

Bureaus typically consist of a general council, which organise votes from workers in subsidiary companies into *company ballots*, which are used to establish standards and self-regulate industry. Bureau membership also allows interaction with the [Vekllei International Market](/finance), and provide a means for foreign investment and export. Companies within bureaus still compete against each other.

The largest bureaus include *Electra* and *Universal Cotton*. Electra represents a collection of state-owned electricity generation companies, and Universal Cotton consists of over a hundred individual clothing manufacturers. Although state monopolies may form a bureau in part or as a whole, bureau membership does not necessarily imply state ownership.
