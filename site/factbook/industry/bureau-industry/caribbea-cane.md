 <span class="fi fi-caribbea-cane fis"></span> **Caribbea Cane** S.p.A. is a [[bureau-industry|bureau corporation]] that monopolises sugar cultivation, refining and manufacturing in [[Vekllei]]. It coordinates dozens of constituent companies that manage over 212,000 hectares of cane farmland across [[Verde]] and [[Lucaya]]. It also directly operates three super-refinery complexes that serve as critical bacterial culture media production sites for the synthetic meat industry in Vekllei. Each super-refinery integrates refining, fermentation and nutrient blending facilities, forming a decentralised, high-capacity supply chain for agro-industrial food production.

Caribbea Cane functions as both a traditional agricultural-industrial cooperative and a strategic biomanufacturing centre. It supplies sugar, amino acids and growth media for national food security. Its refineries in [[Praia]], [[Bahama]] and [[Mira]] are some of the largest in the world, each processing ~23 million tonnes of cane annually with integrated bagasse cogeneration and desalination plants.

The bureau also produces feedstock for fermentation plants that produce vitamins, recombinant proteins and lipids for cultivated meat, as well as export sugar for regional trade. Its decentralised infrastructure links tropical cane belts with mainland bioreactor factories through Vekllei's freight and loading network. Between its super-refineries Caribbea processes about 4.8 million tonnes of sugar per year.
