<span class="fi fi-commonwealth-arsenal fis"></span> **Commonwealth Arsenal** S.A. is the primary artillery and heavy weapons manufacturer in [[Vekllei]]. It is a constituent of the [[Ministry of Defence]], operating six major foundries and production facilities across [[Oslola]], with additional workshops in [[Kala]] and [[Demon]].

The company traces its origins to the Royal Oslolan Foundry, established in 1643 during the North Sea Empire period to produce naval cannon and fortress artillery. It supplied weapons throughout the Oslolan Commonwealth's territorial holdings and became renowned for the quality of its bronze and iron castings.

Following Vekllei independence, the foundry was reorganised as Commonwealth Arsenal and expanded to include modern artillery systems, naval guns and vehicle-mounted weapons. The company developed the GUN-90 field howitzer and NG-series naval guns currently in service with the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]].

Commonwealth Arsenal maintains close relationships with Veletia Armaments for vehicle integration and [[General Reactor]] for nuclear artillery systems. It employs approximately 13,000 people across its facilities and is listed on the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|Commsec]] as CWA.
