Large segments of the [[Vekllei]] economy are dominated by industries of the state, as both direct ministerial privileges and state-owned enterprises. In total, they form the basis of the basic Vekllei standard of living, holding back catastrophe through reliable overproduction where gaps in the participatory economy might threaten serious shortages.

There is no real distinction in Vekllei between *state assets*, *state-owned enterprises* (SOE) and *government-owned corporations* (GOC), and the terms are used interchangeably. A state asset is distinct from [[bureaus|bureau companies]] or [[private-industry|private enterprise]], and is often directed by government policy via an [[ministries|Ministry]] or [[parliaments|Parliament]].

State assets make up about 40% of the total Commonwealth GDP. They occupy central roles in the Vekllei economy, often as functional or constitutional monopolies, and are responsible for 65% of the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|CSX]] market capitalisation.
