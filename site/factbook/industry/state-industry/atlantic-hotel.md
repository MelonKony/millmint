<span class="fi fi-atlantic-hotel fis"></span>  **Atlantic Hotel** is a hospitality company in [[Vekllei]] that manages a portfolio of hotels, resorts, jungle safaris, palaces and spas. It owns 340 properties in over 90 countries, primarily to service Vekllei citizens travelling overseas. Unlike other Vekllei government-owned corporations, the majority of its business is conducted overseas and so operates commercially. It is also unique for its large foreign, waged workforce that are employed in its foreign hotels.

Most of its locations operate under the Atlantic Hotel brand and operate in the premium and upscale segments of the market. Vekllei citizens have priority booking at these properties and have their stays completely subsidised. Foreigners are also able to book Atlantic properties, and about a third of the hotels operated by the company are located in Vekllei [[republics]]. These domestic properties are typically reserved for foreign tourists and businessmen, and are not typically available for Vekllei tourists.

While many Atlantic Hotels were built by the company, it occupies some historic sites. Notable among these is the The Imperial Hotel in London and the Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai.
