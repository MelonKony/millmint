The **[[Avro]] Municipal Police Interceptor** is a police variant of the popular GTV sports sedan manufactured by [[avro|Avro Auto]]. It entered service with municipal [[police]] across [[Vekllei]] in 2055 and has become the standard interceptor patrol vehicle for most republic police services. The interceptor is particularly common in the [[Oslola]] and [[Kalina]], where its distinctive checkered livery is a familiar sight on island roads.

Based on the civilian GTV platform, the police interceptor features an upgraded suspension system, reinforced chassis and a more powerful version of Avro's standard inline-six engine. These modifications give the interceptor exceptional handling and acceleration. Interior modifications strip out a lot of the creature comforts of the regular GTV. The front seats are reinforced with quick-release mechanisms for rapid exit. The dashboard houses additional radio equipment, a computer terminal linked to the National Bulletin System and emergency controls for lights and sirens.

Different republics have customised their interceptors with local variations. [[Oslola]]'s police service operates the largest fleet, while [[Benahoare]]'s municipal police maintain their vehicles in the traditional white and black livery with local parish markings. Smaller island republics often share interceptors between communities, with vehicles rotating on regular schedules.

Production continues at Avro's Pitera facility in [[Karu]], with approximately 50 units manufactured annually to replace aging vehicles and equip newly formed police services.
