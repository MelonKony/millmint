The **[[Avro]] *Commando* Police Armoured Car** is a four-wheeled armoured vehicle operated by [[police]] services across [[Vekllei]] for special operations and emergency response. Introduced in 2058, the Commando serves as a mobile command post and personnel carrier for situations requiring enhanced protection and tactical capability. It is most associated with Police Rifles sections.

The vehicle's design is derived from the military CMD-Naval, which is itself a modified license of the Cadillac Gage Commando APC. Avro modified it in consultation with the [[Ministry of Defence]] to balance capability with the less militarised character of Vekllei policing. Built on a modified Commando chassis, the Commando features a monocoque armoured hull capable of withstanding small arms fire. Like its military cousin, the CMD-Police is amphibious.

In most configurations, a roof-mounted water cannon serves as the primary crowd control system, supplemented by smoke grenade launchers and a spotlight array. Some units retain auxiliary status in the [[Armed Forces]], and include a turret-mounted automatic weapon as part of the militia system, though this remains uncommon.

Interior layout accommodates a driver, commander and gunner in the forward compartment, with space for eight officers in the rear personnel section. Entry occurs through side doors and a rear ramp. Vision blocks provide situational awareness when buttoned up.

[[Oslola]]'s police service operates the largest fleet with 31 vehicles distributed across the republic. The illustration depicts unit 61 from Lola Parish. Other major users include [[Kairi]], [[Karu]] and [[Tenerife]]. Production occurs at Avro's Pitera facility, with approximately 5-8 units manufactured annually. It has seen limited export to the [[Balkan Federation]].
