description: Robots in Vekllei are mobile droids controlled by central optical computers via radio transmission.

aliases:
- /robots/
---

**Robots** (often called *automatics*) in [[Vekllei]] are mobile machines controlled remotely by large [[computers|optical computers]] via radio transmission. These droids perform repetitive tasks across industry, logistics and public services, allowing human workers to focus on roles requiring judgement, creativity or social interaction. Unlike autonomous machines with onboard processing, Vekllei robots are effectively remote-controlled extensions of centralised computer systems.

The country maintains thousands of Automatic Asset Commands -- room-sized optical computers that coordinate fleets of robots through continuous radio signals. A single command system might control hundreds of droids simultaneously, routing them through factories, warehouses, streets or railways with precise coordination. This centralised architecture emerged from Vekllei's early expertise in optical computing and its cultural preference for consolidated technical infrastructure.

## Operation

Vekllei robots are droids in the technical sense -- they possess no independent intelligence or decision-making capability. All processing occurs in an Automatic Asset Command located elsewhere, with robots serving as mobile input-output devices for the central computer.

Many robots can understand human speech and respond in Automatic Language, which sounds like synthesised bells in different tones that are closely associated with morse code and specific phrases.

A typical robot contains:

{{<note>}}
* **Radio receiver and transmitter** for continuous communication with its command computer
* **Sensory equipment** including cameras, proximity sensors and microphones that relay environmental data
* **Motor systems** for locomotion, sometimes wheels or tracks for ground-based units but often rails elsewhere
* **Manipulator arms** or equipment modules for performing specific tasks
* **Power cells** providing several hours of operation before requiring recharge, or an extendable catanery pole
* **Emergency override systems** allowing manual control if radio contact is lost
{{</note>}}

The robot transmits sensory data to its command computer dozens of times per second. The computer processes this information using [[computers|ternary logic systems]], calculates appropriate responses and transmits movement commands back to the robot. This cycle occurs so rapidly that the robot appears to react in real-time to its environment, though all decision-making happens remotely.

**Radio transmission** occurs on dedicated frequencies allocated by the [[Bureau of Automation and Robotics]]. Each Automatic Asset Command operates on assigned channels to prevent interference between different robot fleets. Military and emergency service robots receive priority frequency allocations that cannot be interrupted by industrial systems.

## Types of Robots

Vekllei manufactures several standardised robot chassis used across different sectors:

{{<note>}}
* **Industrial droids** perform factory tasks including assembly, welding, materials handling and quality inspection. These typically remain stationary or move on rails within production facilities. A single Automatic Asset Command in a large factory might coordinate 200-300 industrial droids simultaneously.

* **Logistics droids** transport goods in warehouses, loading facilities and distribution centres. They navigate using painted floor markings detected by optical sensors, with the command computer calculating efficient routing between pickup and delivery points. Larger logistics centres operate dedicated Automatic Asset Commands managing fleets of 400-500 droids.

* **Street maintenance droids** clean pavements, collect refuse and perform minor repairs to public infrastructure. These are most visible to ordinary Vekllei people, operating autonomously but under constant supervision from municipal command computers. They typically work overnight when pedestrian traffic is minimal.

* **Railway droids** operate across the [[CommRail]] network, performing track inspection, signal maintenance and platform cleaning. The Automatic Train Control system coordinates both trains and maintenance droids, ensuring robots clear tracks before passenger services pass through.

* **Police auxiliary droids** patrol assigned areas under direction from precinct command computers. They lack weapons but can physically intervene in disturbances through ramming, emit loud warning sirens and provide communication links to human officers. Constables can summon nearby droids via radio to block roads, provide first aid equipment or check for environmental hazards.

* **Emergency response droids** assist fire brigades and rescue services, operating in environments dangerous to humans. These include firefighting droids capable of entering burning buildings and search-and-rescue units for collapsed structures. Emergency command computers receive priority processing resources during active incidents.

## Design and Components

Most Vekllei robots share common design elements to facilitate maintenance and parts standardisation. The typical chassis consists of:

* A **base unit** housing motors, power cells and primary structural components. This provides stability and supports the weight of equipment modules. Industrial and logistics droids use four-wheeled designs, while police and maintenance units typically employ tracked systems for better terrain handling.

* A **sensor mast** extending upward contains cameras, proximity detectors and the primary radio antenna. This elevated position provides better environmental awareness and maintains clear radio line-of-sight to command antennas. The mast can rotate 360 degrees, though the command computer typically keeps it forward-facing during movement.

* An **equipment rail** allows modular attachments to be mounted and swapped based on task requirements. Police droids might carry first aid kits, communication equipment or dazzling lights. Factory droids mount specialised tools including welding torches, spray painters or precision manipulators. The circular rail allows equipment to swivel independent of the chassis orientation.

* **Manipulator arms** vary significantly by robot type. Simple logistics droids use basic gripping mechanisms, while precision assembly robots employ multiple jointed arms with fine motor control. All manipulators connect to the equipment rail and receive commands through the same radio system controlling locomotion.

* **Emergency systems** provide fallback operation if radio contact is lost. Robots enter a safe mode, stopping movement and activating hazard lights. Police droids automatically broadcast distress signals on emergency frequencies. The robot remains stationary until radio contact resumes or a human operator manually retrieves it.

## Command and Control

Automatic Asset Commands are specialised [[computers|optical computer]] installations designed specifically for robot fleet coordination. These differ from general-purpose computers in several ways:

{{<note>}}
**Real-time processing requirements** demand the computer respond to sensory input and transmit commands within milliseconds. Commands use dedicated processing cores that cannot be interrupted by other tasks, ensuring robots never freeze waiting for computer attention.

**Parallel operation** allows simultaneous control of hundreds of robots. The [[photovolumes|photovolume]] memory systems used in Vekllei computers enable this by storing each robot's status in parallel-accessible crystal structures. The computer can query the state of all robots instantly rather than checking them sequentially.

**Radio interface equipment** includes powerful transmitters, directional antennas and frequency management systems. Large command installations operate multiple redundant radio systems to maintain contact even if primary systems fail.

**Geographic awareness** using stored maps and position data allows the computer to route robots efficiently and avoid collisions. Factory commands maintain precise floor plans, while municipal commands store detailed street maps with real-time updates about construction, traffic or obstacles.

Command facilities require substantial infrastructure. A typical industrial Automatic Asset Command occupies a dedicated climate-controlled room with backup power systems. The computer itself fills several equipment cabinets, with additional space for radio equipment, [[photovolumes|photovolume]] storage arrays and operator workstations. Human supervisors monitor the system through terminals displaying robot status, task queues and system health indicators.

## Social Impact

Robot deployment has fundamentally altered Vekllei labour patterns. The [[commons|moneyless economy]] removes the traditional calculus where automation competes with wage labour. Instead, robots exist to eliminate work that people find tedious, dangerous or physically demanding. Workers displaced by automation move to roles requiring human interaction, judgement or creativity -- sectors that have expanded substantially as industrial employment declined.

* Public acceptance of robots remains high because they visibly improve quality of life. Street cleaning droids maintain tidier public spaces. Logistics automation ensures reliable goods distribution. Factory robots perform repetitive assembly that would otherwise require human workers in monotonous roles. The visible presence of police auxiliary droids has reduced petty crime in some areas while providing emergency assistance capabilities.

* Technical limitations prevent robots from replacing all human labour. The radio control system requires line-of-sight or relay infrastructure, limiting operation in remote areas, underground facilities or dense urban canyons where signal propagation fails. The centralised command architecture creates vulnerability -- if a command computer fails, its entire robot fleet stops functioning. This has prompted the [[Bureau of Automation and Robotics]] to mandate backup command systems for critical infrastructure.

* Maintenance demands create substantial employment. Robots require regular servicing, component replacement and repair after malfunctions. Maintenance technicians form a growing profession, with training provided by the [[Bureau of Automatics]]' Automatic Systems Training Institute. Some factories employ more maintenance staff than they would have needed assembly workers before automation.

## Future Development

Current research focuses on improving radio systems to enable robot operation in challenging environments. The [[DSRE]] develops signal relay drones that hover above urban areas, extending command computer reach into previously inaccessible zones. Underground facilities experiment with wired control systems using fibre optic cables to maintain communication in subway tunnels and mine shafts.

Increased processing power in newer Automatic Asset Commands will expand fleet sizes. Current systems manage 300-500 robots comfortably, but prototype installations handle over 1,000 simultaneous connections. This could enable city-wide robot coordination under unified command systems rather than separate installations for each district or facility.

The [[Ministry of Defence]] continues developing military applications, including combat droids controlled from armoured command vehicles and aerial drones for reconnaissance. These systems face additional challenges around signal security and jamming resistance that remain classified.
