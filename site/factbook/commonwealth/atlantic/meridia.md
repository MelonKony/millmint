The <span class="fi fi-meridia-4x3"></span> **Meridia Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic Ocean, the westernmost island of the Canary archipelago found south of [[Benahoare]]. Its triangular landmass rises abruptly from deep Atlantic waters, crowned by volcanic peaks and bounded by steep cliffs that have earned it the sobriquet "the fortress island." The interior is dominated by ancient calderas and a highland plateau where much of the island's agriculture and settlement occurs.

Meridia was known to the Canarii as *Hero-akran*, meaning "edge of the great water," though over centuries of Portuguese rule this evolved into the modern Meridia. Among the Canary islands, it retained perhaps the strongest indigenous character during the colonial period, owing to its remote location and the diplomatic cunning of its Bimbache chiefs who negotiated tributary status rather than outright conquest when the Portuguese arrived in 1483.

The Bimbaches had developed one of the most sophisticated water management systems in the Atlantic world, channeling the island's sparse rainfall through an intricate network of stone channels and underground *galer√≠as* that remain the backbone of the island's water supply today. Their society was organised around extended clan networks that controlled different sections of the highland plateau, trading obsidian tools, woven goods, and preserved fish with Berber merchants who made regular stops during their trans-Atlantic trading expeditions.

The result was a unique colonial society where Portuguese settlers, primarily from the Azores and Madeira, intermarried extensively with Bimbache families and adopted many local customs. Catholic missions established schools that taught in both Portuguese and Bimbache Canarii, creating a literate indigenous population unusual in the Atlantic colonial world. Traditional Bimbache metalworking, enhanced by Portuguese techniques, made Meridia famous throughout the Portuguese empire for its iron tools and weapons forged from the island's volcanic ore.

Modern Meridia retains this distinctive character. The capital, Sabinosa, is built around a colonial Portuguese plaza but its old town reflects centuries of Canarii-Portuguese synthesis. Houses feature traditional Bimbache wind-resistant construction using volcanic stone, combined with Portuguese tile work and wrought iron that incorporates Canarii geometric patterns learned through their historic North African connections. These motifs have been carried into Commonwealth construction, which integrates local patterns in its typical syncretic fashion.

The republic's economy centres on traditional industries that have evolved with Commonwealth membership. Iron working continues in small forges scattered across the highlands, now producing precision tools for the Commonwealth's industrial sectors. The island's famous *quesadillas herre√±as* cheese, made according to recipes that blend Bimbache preservation techniques with Portuguese dairy methods, is exported throughout the [[atlantic|Atlantic Commonwealth]]. Fishing remains important, with Meridian boats operating from small harbours carved into the volcanic coastline.

Agriculture on the highland plateau follows ancient terracing systems, now supplemented by colonial and contemporary crops. Wine production, using both indigenous grape varieties and Portuguese *vinho verde* techniques, produces distinctive vintages that reflect the island's volcanic soils. Livestock, particularly the hardy local goats descended from Berber breeds introduced through pre-colonial trade, graze the highland pastures.

The island's transport system reflects its challenging geography. A single railway line circles the coastal settlements, with a branch climbing to the highland plateau through a series of switchbacks and tunnels. Several of the more isolated fishing villages are accessible only by coastal tramway or on foot along ancient Bimbache paths that wind through the volcanic landscape. Ferry connections link Meridia to the rest of the Canary republics, with the main terminal in Sabinosa's protected harbour.

Meridians maintain their Bimbache identity alongside Portuguese and Commonwealth influences. Many still practice traditional crafts including basket weaving using local rushes and volcanic glass cutting for decorative work. The annual *Transfiguraci√≥n* festival combines Catholic observance with ancient Bimbache seasonal celebrations, featuring traditional dances performed to the accompaniment of Canarii drums and Portuguese string instruments.

Most Meridians speak Bimbache Canarii at home and Portuguese in towns, with English used for Commonwealth business and education. The whistling communication system once used across the island's deep valleys survives in rural areas, though modern telecommunications have reduced its everyday use. Portuguese influence is strongest in coastal towns, while the highland settlements retain more distinctly Canarii character.

Subtropical with strong trade wind influence. The highland plateau experiences more rainfall and cooler temperatures than the arid coastal areas.
