The <span class="fi fi-pico-4x3"></span> **Pico Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic Ocean, sitting in the central group of the Azores archipelago. The island is dominated entirely by Pico Mountain, which rises 2,351 metres above sea level to become the highest peak in the Atlantic Ocean and all of Vekllei. The mountain is an active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1720, though fumaroles near the summit still release volcanic gases as a reminder of its restless geology.

The island's settlement hugs the coastline in a narrow band around the base of the mountain, where volcanic soils have been broken into tiny plots separated by walls of black basalt stone. These distinctive *currais* create a UNESCO-recognised cultural landscape where generations of Piquenses have cultivated wine grapes in sheltered enclosures protected from salt spray and wind. The resulting wines, particularly the white *Verdelho*, have earned international recognition and remain central to the republic's economy and identity.

Pico's population clusters in three main centres along different coasts. Madalena, the capital, sits on the western shore facing the neighbouring island of [[Fayal]], connected by frequent ferry service. The northern town of São Roque serves as the republic's industrial centre, with small-scale fish processing and boat repair facilities. Lajes do Pico on the southeastern coast maintains the republic's whaling heritage as a museum and cultural centre, commemorating an industry that once defined island life but ceased operations in the 1980s.

The interior remains largely uninhabited wilderness. Above 1,000 metres, vegetation gives way to volcanic scree and alpine conditions. The highland zone contains several caves formed by ancient lava tubes, some extending for kilometres beneath the surface. These caves maintain constant cool temperatures and have historically been used for storing wine and cheese. Today they attract researchers studying volcanic geology and unique cave ecosystems.

Piquenses maintain a strong connection to the sea despite living in the shadow of the mountain. Fishing for tuna and grouper remains important, and since the prohibition of whaling many whales can be seen in the rich waters surrounding the island. They supplement their diet with lamb and dairy.

Transport around Pico follows the coastal road that circles the island, with regular tram services connecting the main towns. [[CommRail]] runs a service along the northern coast from Madalena to São Roque, primarily carrying agricultural products and tourists rather than daily commuters. The island maintains a small airport with flights to other Azores republics, though most visitors arrive by ferry from [[Fayal]]. Getting to the mountain summit requires serious preparation and many visitors hire local guides familiar with the changeable weather conditions.

The population speaks Portuguese predominantly, with English generally understood. The republic receives steady visitors from around the country throughout the year, drawn by the wine culture and opportunities to climb the mountain. Summer brings the peak season when weather conditions favour both activities, while winter sees quieter periods when locals focus on wine production and maintenance of the distinctive stone walls that characterise the landscape. Pico is famous for its white-walled inns that house travelers for a bit of help around the vineyards.
