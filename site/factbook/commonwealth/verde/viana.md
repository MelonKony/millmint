The <span class="fi fi-viana-4x3"></span> **Viana Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic, off the coast of the African Sahara. It is a small archipelago of four desert islands, only the largest of which (the island of Viana) is inhabited. The main island rises nearly 800 meters from the surface of the Atlantic, and overlooks its smaller, uninhabited islands and islets. The capital of the republic is called Mindelo, and is among the most populated and prosperous cities of [[verde|Commonwealth Verde]], famous for its pretty modernist architecture that practices odd fusion with the colourful and vivacious culture of its people.

The history of Viana as a republic is the history of Mindelo, its capital, where 95% of its people live. Its tower apartments and dense urban core better resemble Singapore than the rest of Verde, and about 320,000 people live there. After being settled by the Portuguese in the late 18th Century, the port town served an important role as a coaling (and later, oiling) station for British and Portuguese ships. The decline of this industry precipitated the decline of Mindelo, and by the time of Vekllei accession only 12,000 people lived there. The city has since grown rapidly, largely because it was a preliminary foreign migration site after the reestablishment of the Commonwealth in 2017.

The island of Viana is roughly rectangular and flat among the greater archipelago, and its uninhabited islands are mountainous and have almost no vegetation at all, giving them an alien and moonlike quality. These other islands, the largest of which is called Lucia, have no obvious utility but are home to several unique and endangered birds and animals, and are protected as national parks. A large meteorological station established by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] on Lucia is the only infrastructure there. Viana is greener but still dry, and most of its agriculture comprises smallholdings, some homesteads and aquaponics. Mindelo has a good port with a [[Commonwealth Oil]] refinery.

Vianans are cheerful and indulge any opportunity to celebrate. The islanders are famous for a week-long carnival stretching between Shrove Monday and Mardi Gras, which fuses Portuguese and Brazilian Catholic traditions. They eat a lot of seafood, and catch a lot of fish mostly by spearfishing from wooden boats. Mindelo is the third-most populous republic in the Verde archipelago, after [[Java]] and [[Praia]], and facilitates a lot of its civil service and commerce. While the republic itself has only small developed industries related to petroleum refining and food processing, it is a hub of culture and hosts major corporations, government bureaus and collectives.

The republic has good schools and hospitals, and the island of Viana is well-connected by trains. It also has the largest airport in its region.
