The <span class="fi fi-volcanic-4x3"></span> **Volcanic Commonwealth** (*Vekllei Volcanic*) is a [constituent commonwealth](/constituents/) of [[Vekllei]], comprising the island of [[Oslola]], its largest and most populous [republic](/republics/), as well as the North Atlantic republics of [[Demon]], [[Hetland]] and [[Aismious]]. They share a common Scandinavian cultural heritage, but differ dramatically in population, history and ethnic makeup. Oslola is Vekllei's largest single republic and its history contributed significantly to the formation of [[Vekllei]]. It has a large, diverse population. Demon and Aismious have unique histories mostly seperate from Oslola, and their representation in the Volcanic Commonwealth reflect their common geographic interests.

All republics of the Commonwealth receive midnight sun during portions of the year, and have similar subarctic and tundra climates. [[Demon]] and [[Aismious]] are mostly treeless, but [[Oslola]] has substantial areas of cold-weather rainforest, and is warmed by ocean currents.
