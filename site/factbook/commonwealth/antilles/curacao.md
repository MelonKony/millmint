The <span class="fi fi-curacao-4x3"></span> **Republic of Curacao** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the western Caribbean Sea north of Venezuela, and part of the country of [[Vekllei]]. It is situated between two neighbouring Vekllei republics, [[Aruba]] and [[Bonaire]], which together make up the ABC islands of the [[antilles|Commonwealth Antilles]].

Curacao is the largest and historically the most industrious of the Vekllei Antilles, and plays an important economic and cultural role in the history of the region. It was the home of the first Jews in the Western Hemisphere -- mostly Sephardic Jewish migrants from Spain and Portugal. That community persists to this day, and makes up about a fifth of the population. The remainder are a mix of black Antilleans including Arawak Indians -- comprising three fifths -- and a mix of hispanics and whites mostly descended from Europe and neighbouring Latin American countries.

The island was originally home to Arawak Indians before European discovery in 1499. It was first colonised by the Spanish and, later, the Dutch, who used it as a centre of trade in their Caribbean empire. It has one of the finest natural harbours in the West Indies, which was exploited by the Dutch through their participation in both the salt and slave trades. While afflicted throughout history by privateers, the island remained in Dutch hands until the Napoleonic Wars, when it was captured and incorporated by the British.

The construction of the Antilles Nuclear Generation Establishment, centred around the commonwealth fusion reactor, transformed Curacao's exports in the mid 2030s. The complex was constructed on the site of the former oil power plant within the Shell Refinery, and exports considerable power to Venezuela and Colombia. Undersea power cables also supply power to [[Aruba]] and [[Bonaire]]. Coming from the other end of history, Curacao is famous for its historic orange orchards, the peels of which are a key ingredient in its famous liqueurs. Like the other ABC islands, Curacao has limited fresh water and relies on desalination plants in the south of the island to process seawater.

Because of the island's location close to both Venezuala's oil reserves and the Panama Canal, Curacao has played a strategic economic role facilitated by its deep natural harbour and relative political stability. The Shell Refinery there, now part of [[Commonwealth Oil]], continues to play an important (though diminished) role in global oil processing. Starting in the mid-2030s, some of its capacity was moved to the refinery on [[Aruba]]. The refinery still has a presence in Korsou's inland harbour and maintains a fuel terminal on its northwest coast. The island also maintains Vekllei's third-busiest port.

Like the other ABC islands, Curacao buildings are brightly coloured and built in the Dutch Colonial style. The capital, Korsou, is bisected by a deep canal that connects its inland harbour with the Caribbean Sea. The republic is particularly famous for its cuisine and liqueur, which are influenced by Portuguese and Afro-Caribbean traditions. *Stoba* is a stew made with goat and papaya and *kadushi* is cactus soup. Curacao liqueur, as it is known, was invented there and is very refreshing. Indonesian cuisine is also quite popular, and the island is home to a small Indonesian diaspora.

A railway runs from north to south, supplemented by trams in the capital and outlying settlements. There is an airport on the northeast side of the island, and regular ferry service to the other ABC islands.
