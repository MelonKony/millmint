The <span class="fi fi-antilles-4x3"></span> **Antilles Commonwealth** (*Vekllei Antilles*) is a [constituent commonwealth](/constituents/) of [[Vekllei]], comprising its islands in the Leeward Antilles. These include the "ABC islands" off the west coast of Venezuela, and the [[Caimanas]] in the West Caribbean Sea. All of them are densely-populated and highly industrialised, which facilitates their tradition as trading ports. Unlike other parts of the Vekllei Antilles, the ABC islands have a dry climate and xeric landscape, giving them their characteristic desert appearance. The Caimanas, some ways to their north, are tropical coral islands.

The Caimanas are a regional banking capital of Vekllei, and conduct strong trade with North and Central America.
