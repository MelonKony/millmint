The <span class="fi fi-providence-4x3"></span> **Republic of Providence** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the southwest Caribbean Sea northeast of [[Abakoa]] as part of the west Antilles island chain. It is a pear-shaped island that is slightly smaller than its sister island and much less populated.

When the Providence Island Company established their Puritan settlement here in 1630, they chose the most dramatically beautiful spot in the western Caribbean: a volcanic island whose peaks rise nearly 400 meters from azure waters, wrapped in coral reefs that Spanish galleons learned to fear. The experiment lasted barely two decades before Spanish forces finally dislodged the Protestant colonists in 1651, but those twenty-one years established a character that distinguishes Providence from every other [[Antilles]] settlement. Providence has a peculiar blend of Puritan work ethic and buccaneering independence that would later make the island a natural haven for escaped slaves and political refugees.

The British reclaimed Providence in 1670 as part of the Treaty of Madrid, transforming what had been a theological experiment into a thriving commercial outpost. Unlike the sugar-obsessed colonies to the east, Providence developed a more diverse economy based on logwood cutting, turtle fishing and what contemporaries diplomatically call "irregular commerce," which in those days involved privateers operating against Spanish shipping. Henry Morgan himself maintained a house there between expeditions, and local legend insists his ghost still walks the heights above Freetown during the full moon.

Providenceans remain mostly Protestant with a minority Catholic population, and speak mostly English and Abakoan Creole. Almost all of them live on the coast in small communities and many are skilled gardeners. Providence is famous for its gardens and general colourfulness, which decorates homes and street furniture.

The republic's economy has evolved from buccaneering to more respectable pursuits, most famously coconut plantations on the gentler western slopes and a small but renowned boat-building industry that produces some of the Caribbean's finest racing sloops. The island is situated southwest of a number of number of reefs and cays that reach towards [[Caimanas]], most of which remain federal territory. The Petrel Islands maintain an airship docking station and a [[marine|Marine Services]] outpost. Providence is ringed by a rail line, and a fast tram connects the interior to the capital. The surrounding Seaflower Reef is extraordinary pretty and is an attraction for visitors from all around the country.
