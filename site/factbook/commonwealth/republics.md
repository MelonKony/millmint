A **Constituent Republic** is type of city-state that make up the country of [[Vekllei]]. They retain autonomy and devolved powers, but have acceded to the state of Vekllei and are part of that country. They are organised into [constituent commonwealths](/constituents/), which serve as an intermediate level of administration between the federal and republican governments. The largest republics have millions of people; the smallest have only a few thousand.

There are a few criteria separating republics from regular local government. They are generally self-sufficient, and include surrounding areas capable of agriculture and industry. They also retain their own lower courts, and have a strengthened local democracy consisting of a popular assembly (the Municipal Assembly) and Ecclesia -- special-purpose councils of important civic citizens and industrial representatives.
