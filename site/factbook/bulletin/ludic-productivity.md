**Summary**

* Large parts of the Vekllei economy are ostensibly owned by the Vekllei {{<link/government>}}.
* Even though these companies are [government-owned](/state-industry/), they usually operate independently and some are profitable through foreign trade.
* While private companies in the domestic market can only effectively go "bankrupt" through prolonged labour shortages, government companies with [accounted revenue](/bulletin/accounted-revenue/) can and do go bankrupt.
* The question then is how the Vekllei state handles bankruptcy of government-owned and major industrial firms, and to what it extent it allows ailing businesses to run at a loss.

Work in {{<link/vekllei>}} -- in fact, most factors of life in Vekllei -- is characterised by *play*. Play is a distinguishing characteristic of social creatures and it is all around us, even if we might not recognise it as such. It is not idealism or altruism; it is intuitive to all of us, and like other basic social motivations does not need to be taught or conceptualised. We play for entertainment, gratification and fun. Vekllei people work for entertainment, gratification and fun.

Yet bricks are still moved; the rubbish is collected; teachers show up in classrooms and clerks are at their desks. They produce forms of value for their country; physical labour, services, and yes, money-value. In this article we'll look at ludic productivity in Vekllei, its features, and how it informs the character of Vekllei society.

## Homo Ludens

Play is a process of structuring freedom, or more specifically, free time. It is both spontaneous and organised, natural and structured. It is done for its own sake, yet it is also closely linked to the great achievements of human society -- language, law, science, the arts.

Many foundations of human society, taken as immutable and preexisting in modern times, have their origins in kinds of play. Johan Huizinga (1935) argues that play is older than culture itself, occurring throughout the animal kingdom with no functional purpose -- it is self-justifying, spontaneous, and establishes a space seperate from functionalism and utility. It is a driving force for human culture, which in turn has established the foundational -- and very real -- features of civilised society. Contests, duels, competition, symbolism, all inform culture and arise from play.

In Vekllei, they [do not use money in everyday life](/social-economy/). This society is known as the *commons*, or a *social economy*. Because a social economy cannot support wage labour as we think of it, productivity and work have to be structued and measured in different ways. In Vekllei, people commit to work for social reasons, many of which resemble what we might call *play* in the literal sense.

**Example**

Play arises naturally in Vekllei because the mechanisms of its social economy limit the kind of industrialisation that strips culture of playfulness. For example, films made in Vekllei are almost all low-budget, small-scale affairs. It is a scene dominated by amateurs with a camera, who have to work strenuously to meet the production values of even small-time Hollywood features.

Vekllei filmmakers cannot pay actors or rent sets, because they have no money. Any accomodation of filmmakers comes from reputation and charity, not financial incentive (towns may close off a street to accomodate a prestigious director, in the same fashion that talent is attracted to talent).

Vekllei people sometimes lament this culture, derisively calling it pretentious ('arthouse') or backwards ('shoddy'). But these economic limitations also prevent the industrialisation of cinema, and so in place of industry is the spontaneity and self-asserting nature of play. It is a good example of how economic structure can impart cultural traits, and vice-versa. It is not just that their culture encourages play; play is in fact an response to their economic reality.

This kind of democracy of culture applies to all kinds of achievements in Vekllei life -- from athletes to novelists. It encourages the proliferation of community newspapers and magazines, sporting clubs. These limitations, arising from an economic inability to industrialise culture, characterises culture itself. It is more common than not to meet Vekllei people with professions outside of their formal occupation, working in hobby clubs, associations and individual creative work. In function they are no different to work -- they are structured, social and equally unpaid. Yet Vekllei people distinguish between them nonetheless.

As a result, Vekllei people are not just passive observers of sports and media but active participants in it. The line between hobbyists and professionals is blurred, and contributes to a staggering per-capita cultural output. This does not have much bearing on the quality of what they create, but a tremendous effect on the character of their society. Far from children stuck in an eternal, inconsequential, coddled play-state, Vekllei people are well-rounded, sophisticated and tuned in.

## Living Through Play

This produces naturally what Johan Huizinga[^huizinga] calls a *play community*, in the sense that there is a common form of ludic productivity. Like other forms of play, it has its own rituals -- and in Vekllei, amusingly, these rituals imitate industrial productivity.

It should be no surprise that work in Vekllei looks much like work overseas. This is for the same reasons that Vekllei people [use honourifics and insist on courtesy](/bulletin/courtesy/) -- they are people, not anarchists. To abolish the dress code, tea break and work-desk is to misunderstand ludic productivity -- it functions in a liminal position between the fantasy and real, and depends on both in the structured fashion play often does.

* On one hand, ludic productivity is participating in the same fantasy as a child playing doctor or house -- they wear these uniforms and perform these roles in imitation of the office overseas.
* On the other, Vekllei workers are adults and have adult expectations about professionalism, competence and productivity in the workplace

Both of these concepts feed into play. In industrial productivity, professionalism is an expectation -- a burden. In Vekllei, it is a social behaviour -- nonetheless expected, but part of the play-fantasy. There are many kinds of work that do not directly participate in this play-fantasy, especially where they meet responsibilities that require procedures or technical decision-making, but they are nonetheless insulated in it. The procedure is the details, but the role of work -- the ludic element of productivity -- is as a ritual.

 **Example**

Commercial airline pilots perform a technical, well-regulated role. Nonetheless, the specifics of their work and precision of their labour are insulated in the same ludic rituals encouraged by material benefit and the complex social rewards of Vekllei society. To be a pilot is a glamorous profession, and inspires respect. As such, its ludic elements are straightforward -- the cap, pin and uniform, respect, and the achievement and responsibility of flying an aircraft. All dimensions are social or physical.

Play is not antagonistic to responsibility, technical proficiency, or productive output. In fact, all those things can contribute to its status as play.

## Play Takes Over

Like all industrial societies, Vekllei industry is preoccupied with efficiency and productivity. Vekllei is in fact a [highly productive society](/bulletin/productivity/), because it has efficient automatic systems and talented, motivated workers. Yet there is also considerable separation between the two.

Rationalism is a powerful thing, and it is necessary to design beautiful systems that can raise the standard of living fairly. But it is also antithetical to the social factors underpinning Vekllei workplaces. In this sense, industrial (automatic)[^automatic] systems and human ones are antagonist, as they operate on competing economic logic. And there *is* economic logic in the ludic productivity, as outlined in the bulletin above, which produces effective outcomes for the kinds of roles a person excels in.

Industrialisation and efficient planning has been very effective at improving Vekllei's material standard of living, but

## Real Voluntarism

Although ludic productivity is less coerced by material interests, it would be misleading to characterise it as voluntary. First of all, it simply is not voluntary -- all working-age people in Vekllei need some kind of occupation by law, an obligation known as *[contributory service](/consosva/)*.[^service] That obligation however is commonly theoretical rather than material, since what they call work is a feature of life and occurs naturally and spontaneously.

 Material pressures are not the only mechanism with which to coerce people, and Vekllei is a country of strong social pressures.[^conformity] It is quite possible to be coerced into social obligations with no material reward or punishment. A variety of normal interactions can produce nonmaterial, though very real, coercive behaviour.

 As such, it is not accurate to describe ludic productivity in Vekllei as voluntary without qualification, in the fashion of orthodox utopian anarchy. Vekllei people sometimes do things they would not otherwise want to do, and this includes labour for others. Rather than indicating a corruption of voluntarism, however, this actually indicates an abolition of work. Because it now exists primarily in social dimensions, it lacks the material benefit and consequence of labour as labour, and so does not really resemble "work" as we understand it at all. Instead, the Vekllei use of the term defaults to one of two meanings.

 1. Work is energy spent on getting things done
 2. Work is the play-fantasy of going into a workplace and performing roles (ludic productivity)

 As a consequence, these begrudging social obligations demonstrate that the physical obligation of work is gone (except for that distant legal obligation). The fact that Vekllei people continue to go into the workplace for no pay and under no threat indicates that work as we think of it does not exist at all.

 The distinction is important, because the physical and blunt mechanics of industrial relationships, previously insulated behind the social rituals of work, are now absent. The physical coercion (the need to earn and eat) is gone, except in that distant legal obligation -- a thorny but important caveat.

 The role of that legal obligation is not really as a carrot or a stick. Make no mistake -- it can be prosecuted, and you can be physically coerced into labour as part of community service. But that sort of blunt coercion is rarely necessary. Instead, it indicates to members of society th

 This indicates the general state of Vekllei pragmatism, which is generally untethered from absolutes (voluntary, freedom, hierarchy, autonomy, coercion) and is concerned with the function of independence, pleasure and dignity. If the absolute of voluntary work prohibits in function the wellbeing of ludic productivity, it is sanded off as needed until it fits.

 ## Is this Utopia? I Thought it Was Hell

 Lest readers come away with the impression that life in Vekllei is an endless play in the feast-day light, it is no such thing. It has strict benefits and strict limitations. Those benefits -- of ludic productivity, of democratic society, of dignity and independence -- are the products of a system that has to curtail wealth, reward and expertise. These are people, not anarchists. They move on complicated emotions, and make good and bad decisions.

 ## Play as a Triumph of Commonwealth Society

[^huizinga]: See also *Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture*, 1938. This work is influential on Vekllei and is a useful reference for this article.
[^automatic]: Vekllei industry is mostly automatic. This does not mean entirely without human workers, but typically people serve administrative and technical roles rather than assembly or maintenance work in industrial contexts.
[^service]: *Contributory Service* is a requirement to register an occupation until retirement. This does not necessarily imply work -- education, homemaking and many other occupations not usually regarded as employment often qualify. Although it is a legal requirement, it is rarely prosecuted.
[^conformity]: It is important not to obscure Vekllei's complex and powerful social functions as simple collectivism; they are not, buy and large, collectivists. They have a Western conceptualisation of the individual, though they are substantially more codependent on their communities than your average European or American.
