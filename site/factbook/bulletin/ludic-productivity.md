**Summary**

* Large parts of the Vekllei economy are ostensibly owned by the Vekllei {{<link/government>}}.
* Even though these companies are [government-owned](/state-industry/), they usually operate independently and some are profitable through foreign trade.
* While private companies in the domestic market can only effectively go "bankrupt" through prolonged labour shortages, government companies with [accounted revenue](/bulletin/accounted-revenue/) can and do go bankrupt.
* The question then is how the Vekllei state handles bankruptcy of government-owned and major industrial firms, and to what it extent it allows ailing businesses to run at a loss.

Work in Vekllei -- in fact, any factor of life in {{<link/vekllei>}} -- is characterised by *play*. Play is a distinguishing characteristic of social creatures and it is all around us, even if we might not recognise it as such. It is not idealism or altruism; it is intuitive to all of us, and like other basic social motivations does not need to be taught or conceptualised.

When we talk about work being characterised by *play*, work-as-play, the abolition of work, ludic productivity or any other phrase, we mean the same thing in Vekllei. Because

## Real Voluntarism

Although ludic productivity is less coerced by material interests, it would be misleading to characterise it as voluntary. First of all, it simply is not voluntary -- all working-age people in Vekllei need some kind of occupation by law, an obligation known as *[contributory service](/consosva/)*. That obligation however is commonly theoretical rather than material, since what they call work is a feature of life and occurs naturally and spontaneously.

 Material pressures are not the only mechanism with which to coerce people, and Vekllei is a country of strong social pressures.[^conformity] It is quite possible to be coerced into social obligations with no material reward or punishment. A variety of normal interactions can produce nonmaterial, though very real, coercive behaviour.

 As such, it is not accurate to describe ludic productivity in Vekllei as voluntary without qualification, in the fashion of orthodox utopian anarchy. Vekllei people sometimes do things they would not otherwise want to do, and this includes labour for others. Rather than indicating a corruption of voluntarism, however, this actually indicates an abolition of work. Because it now exists primarily in social dimensions, it lacks the material benefit and consequence of labour as labour, and so does not really resemble "work" as we understand it at all. Instead, the Vekllei use of the term defaults to one of two meanings.

 1. Work is energy spent on getting things done
 2. Work is the play-fantasy of going into a workplace and performing roles (ludic productivity)

 As a consequence, these begrudging social obligations demonstrate that the physical obligation of work is gone (except for that distant legal obligation). The fact that Vekllei people continue to go into the workplace for no pay and under no threat indicates that work as we think of it does not exist at all.

 The distinction is important, because the physical and blunt mechanics of industrial relations and capital that are insulated behind the social rituals of work are now absent. The physical coercion (the need to earn and eat) is gone, except in that distant legal obligation.

 This indicates the general state of Vekllei pragmatism, which is generally untethered from absolutes (voluntary, freedom, hierarchy, autonomy, coercion) and is concerned with the function of independence, pleasure and dignity. If the absolute of voluntary work prohibits in function the wellbeing of ludic productivity, it is sanded off as needed until it fits.

 ## Characteristics of Vekllei Ludic Productivity

 It is not just that Vekllei work blends work and play -- all professional work is a form of play. It is a social

[^conformity]: It is important not to obscure Vekllei's complex and powerful social functions as simple collectivism; they are not, buy and large, collectivists. They have a Western conceptualisation of the individual, though they are substantially more codependent on their communities than your average European or American.
