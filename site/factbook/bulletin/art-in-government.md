**Summary**

* Art in [[Vekllei]] is neither industrialised, nor is it especially romanticised. It is a feature of life and many people contribute art or are employed in it in some capacity.
* In this context, the Commonwealth (federal) government of the country deals directly with artists; it produces its own paintings, sculpture and music,
* This helps give some direction to common artists and also helps justify their employment in that capacity full-time.
* The result is a government that contributes art to society, not in a contracted or external aspect but directly and passionately.

* federal art project in the works progress administration
* rather than insulated in contracters and agencies the government deals with artists individually, and in a sense takes ownership over that work
* consequently there is not as much of a distinction between artists as private creatives and government; they work collaboratively and government is allowed to have an opinion on art
* this is especially the case when combined with the independent, autonomous and powerful nature of the dispersed, federal government office

> Cedric Larson stated that "The impact made by the five major cultural projects of the WPA upon the national consciousness is probably greater in total than anyone readily realizes. As channels of communication between the administration and the country at large, both directly and indirectly, the importance of these projects cannot be overestimated, for they all carry a tremendous appeal to the eye, the ear, or the intellectâ€”or all three."[31]:â€Š491â€Š"
