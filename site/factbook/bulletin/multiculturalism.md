**Summary**

* The Commonwealth is a deeply multicultural country, and is home to people with ancestry in all corners of the world.
* It is also a society of tight social cohesion, famous for its trusting and codependent communities.
* Facilitating cohesion requires careful management, since cultural differences can encourage anomy, prejudice and the proliferation of enclaves in society.
* These social ills damage trust, opportunity, prosperity and the common sense of identity essential to the functioning of Vekllei society.
* Consequently, administrating integration and cohabitation is a matter of national priority for their government.

The [[vekllei|Commonwealth]] has a strong civic identity, and there is no mistaking it for anything else. It is home to about 26 million people, and almost all of them have roots somewhere else. Although the country is home to many indigenous groups,[^indigenous] the vast majority of Vekllei people have ancestry going back only a few hundred years. Many of them arrived in the colonial period as slaves or settlers, a duality which profoundly impacts their current demography. Others arrived ashore in waves of migration -- Irish and Northern Celts, Scandinavians, British and Americans, Southern Europeans, Indians, Chinese and most recently, Africans.

In this sense, empire and immigration characterise the national founding myth. The imperial precursors of Commonwealth federalism have treated the problems of its many cultures in different ways -- most often by exacerbating them in self-interest or cynical exploitation. Today things are different, and society has evolved. The dignity of all people has been recognised after 20th-century barbarism outraged the conscience of mankind, and human rights remain a core principle of civilisation. They are not just political egalitarians but sincere moralists who have a quasireligious commitment to human dignity. As such, it is not just a matter of politics or economics for them; it is a matter of civilisation, and should be approached realistically and sincerely in the pragmatic fashion of their social projects.

Social cohesion is the foundation of all successful societies, but in Vekllei it is especially important. Trust here is reinforced not by a need to survive but complex [[ludic-productivity|social forms]], and so factors that damage social cohesion or a sense of community can spiral into the collapse of productive companies, slowdowns in industry and the fraying of society itself. The corrosion of social cohesion is advanced by two axes of social disease:

* Poverty and deprivation, and its symptoms of strong inequality.
* Distrust and anomy, and its symptoms of prejudice and grievance.

Where these symptoms take root, a breakdown of society follows. The Commonwealth is aware of this, and was diagnosed in plain English in the 2028 publication *Health of Commonwealth Society* by the [[Ministry of Culture]]. This document first organised a comprehensive state approach to racial harmony and integration, which has evolved in the decades since.

Diversity remains one of their great strengths, and Vekllei has prospered tremendously from the talent of its people. Many achievements of their society in arts, law and science have come from an endless and indiscriminate pool of talent, such that listing them all quickly becomes a cliche. Nativism is the enemy of their civilisation; it was nativism that spurred the Oslolan Civil War that left their society irradiated and on the brink of death; it remains nativism that inspires separatism through violence and terror. Confronted with the violence that backs nativist instinct, is it any wonder that they remain universalists?

The social management of people, and the benefits and ills of many types of people living and mixing together, is a major occupation and achievement of Vekllei government.

## The Character of Commonwealth Society

The Commonwealth has among the highest percentage of people born overseas in the world, behind only entrep√¥ts with large guest worker populations. While the country is made up of many races and cultures, they did not arrive at random and they share common beliefs. Many Vekllei people have a similar history -- about three fourths have ancestors that were subjects (or property) of the British Empire. The remainder are mostly the same but were brought by the Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The British Empire's triumph over the world, and its extended colonial domination over the Atlantic has left Vekllei with a common language, administrative tradition and some shared industry and culture. In this sense, colonial conquest and the subjugation of different types of people was the genesis of modern Commonwealth pluralism.

Immigration in Vekllei resembles a mosaic, with different waves of people arriving at different times. The population of the country has doubled since the independence in 2017, largely from immigrants filtered through the [century society laws](/century-society). This system effectively effectively welcomed only those talented or wealthy enough to receive a tertiary education, which in many cases meant familarity with and connections to colonial administration or government overseas. This period of multiculturalism was characterised by change and growth, and the bonds and connections of a community had to be renewed continuously as new people have arrived. This renewal was encouraged by the constant mixing of people in government migrant housing policy and the general deghettoisation of society as the standard of living improved.

During this period, government policy promoted assimilation and integration into Commonwealth norms, and included a range of programmes including:

* Strong government intervention in migrant housing, mixing races and preventing the formation of enclaves;
* A mandatory requirement to know and speak English, which is the functional language of commerce and business in Vekllei;
* Universalising government schooling so that the children of migrants would grow up among different cultures;
* Municipal-level conscription and reservism in organisations like [[Civil Defence]];
* Municipal-level cultural holidays and intercultural events to allow different cultures to celebrate their holidays throughout the year.

This heavy-handed approach to migration eased somewhat in later years, but are still practiced in some form today. There are very few ethnic enclaves in Vekllei, and those that exist are often historic and may even date back to the colonial period. 

This extreme period of growth after independence has levelled off as the century society laws were repealed and migration controls have been introduced, which has changed the nature of cohesion. Where previously community bonds were formed through the continuous meeting and integration of new people in your neighbourhood, they were now maturing and had entered a different type of coexistence. From about 2040 to the present day, a sense of trust and community has been derived from connections and interactions that people accumulate with their neighbours over years and decades. [Strong protections for property](/property/) in Vekllei reinforce this sense of community, because home ownership and land stewardship are a feature of their society, and that legal basis encourages people to live in and improve a single home for an extended period of time. A single home -- and a single community -- have downstream effects on an person's participation, neighbourliness and trust.

Paramount to management of cultures is that the government must be seen nation-building across ethno-religious identities rather than in service of them, and that includes potentially being in competition with them. It is more than just a recognition of a diaspora or its concerns; it comes with obligations to be a good neighbour. This idea, known in Vekllei as interculturalism, is protected by social norms and taboos that look to:

* Counter ghettoisation of ethnicities around religious and cultural cores;
* Counter the reluctance to build intercultural community relations;
* Counter shallow emphasis on celebratory harmony in place of effective and meaningful collaboration and cohabitation;
* Counter the emphasis on internal ethnoreligious divisions in place of intercultural perspective and the common good;
* Counter punitive and inflammatory strategies and activism, even where they do not break the law.

These social norms are not in political service of multiculturalism as a value, but are extensions of Commonwealth culture and society. They are a deeply social people with strong codependence in their communities, and so antisocial behaviour in all its forms -- from petty offences like spitting in public to coordinated political behaviours like belligerance and intolerance -- are offensive to them. The problem of social cohesion and building a shared identity over such a diverse and disparate country is an ongoing challenge, but it is also not artificia or tought -- it is a natural instinct that arises spontaneously in the way they live their lives.


## Diversity in the Commonwealth

Because there are so many races living together in Vekllei, you cannot determine if someone is a foreigner based on their appearance. People in [[Cama]] might be amazed by the white hair of an ethnic Scandinavian from [[Oslola]], but Vekllei people move around a lot and you end up seeing all kinds of people in the street. This is a common feature in the great port cities of the world -- many of which are now part of Vekllei's Atlantic. Vekllei has an internal multiculturalism, and it does not have to be established as an ideal or a political belief because it is simply a fact of their existing, diverse society. 

Multiracialism and coexistence does not have to be justified; it is self-justifying. It does not have to be advocated; it is already the case. So when Vekllei people talk about other ethnicities, their prejudices and rumour are mostly petty and absurd, couched in stereotypes and jokes about food. And because they are surrounded by so many types of people, and have strong affection for the people around them, they are living a remarkably unspoken but everpresent political belief in multiculturalism.

As a political belief, then, a love of all cultures is part of Commownealth political universalism and obsession with the dignity of the person. Multiculturalism as a value depends on the liberal idea of the person as a free subject, and a belief that people should be able to pursue their values and beliefs in the fashion they like, as long as they do not harm anyone else. This normative ideal is rooted in the dignity of the individual, which is also essential to the core of Vekllei political belief. In order to preserve that dignity, and that freedom, opportunities and rights must be universal.

Commonwealth society is comprised of overlapping realms of social capital, strengthened by trust.

* Society is constituted by overlapping realms of social capital strengthened by trust. In multicultural soceities, during conflicts with out others the social capital built within communities may be hardened, while that between groups is diluted if not almost totally dissolved. Moreover, the settlement and social integration experiences of diverse diaspora communities are likely to be affected by an absence of multigenerational social networks that would otherwise facilitate social integration, national attachment and political affiliation. This may lead to a sense of social marginalisation and disempowerment, in many cases breeding resentment and outright hostility. These are symptoms of fragile trust.

* wider communities where people live are comprised of people from many different backgrounds and there is little sense in which immigrant groups can ghettoise or segregated into enclaves.
* Foreign-born Commonwealth people have reasonably similar levels of trust in other people and the government as Vekllei-born people.
* Foreigners have shallower roots but their participation in society develops the longer they live here.
* Vekllei people believe it too, and a common belief in multiculturalism contributes positively to social cohesion in Vekllei.
* Crises and natural disasters have tended to strengthen rather than weaken these beliefs, and are associated with spikes in trust of government and each other.
* Commonwealth people have demonstrated a capacity to rally around and support each other through difficult times.

## Equality and its Downstream Contributions

* Economic disadvantage and deprivation have been shown to be the strongest predictors of individuals social support networks, their levels of trust, sense of belonging, and engagement in their communities. More broadly, absolute deprivation is a direct symptom of societal malfunction that leads one to question whether such deprivation can truly co-exist with social cohesion.

* Economic inequalities are a key driver of social inequalities
* Federalisation and integration with Vekllei also exacerbates existing symptoms of social fraying
* Household finances and quality of life are the single most important predictor of how people perceive cohesion.
* Poor and deprived people are much less likely to say they have a great sense of belonging in Vekllei, and have a much lower sense of happiness and self-worth. They are much less likely to trust other people or agree that multiculturalism has been good for Vekllei.
* Financial and housing security contribute substantially to Vekllei cohesion.
* Vekllei prevents high rates of immigrant turnover. Vekllei people remain most prejudiced towards immigrants from non-Anglo countries, a prejudice also held by black Caribbeans and some immigrants.
