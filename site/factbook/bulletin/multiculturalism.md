**Summary**

* The Commonwealth is a deeply multicultural country, and is home to people with ancestry in all corners of the world.
* It is also a society of tight social cohesion, famous for its trusting and codependent communities.
* Facilitating multicultural cohesion requires careful management, since cultural differences can provoke marginalisation, prejudice and even ghettoisation of communities.
* These social ills damage trust, opportunity, prosperity and the common sense of identity.
* Consequently, administrating integration and multiculturalism is a matter of national priority for their government.
* Their competent and pragmatic approach allows Vekllei to enjoy the strong benefits of a diverse population while protecting the trusting nature of their society.

The [[vekllei|Commonwealth]] is a remarkably stable nation with a strong civic identity. It is home to about 26 million people, and almost all of those people have ancestors that come from somewhere else. Although the country is home to many indigenous groups,[^indigenous] the vast majority of Vekllei people have roots going back only a few hundred years. Many of them arrived in the colonial period as slaves or settlers, a duality which profoundly impacts modern Vekllei demography. Others arrived ashore in waves of migration -- British and Americans, Irish and Northern Celts, Southern Europeans, Indians, Chinese and most recently Africans.

In this sense, empire and immigration characterise and contribute to Vekllei's founding myth. The imperial precursors of Commonwealth federalism have treated the problems of its many cultures in different ways -- most often by exacerbating them in self-interest or cynical competition. Today things are different, and society has evolved. The dignity of all people has been recognised after 20th-century barbarism outraged the conscience of mankind, and human rights remain a core principle of civilisation. In Vekllei, these ideals have to be translated pragmatically, in the realistic and straightforward fashion of its social projects.

Social cohesion is the foundation of all successful societies, but in Vekllei it is especially important. Trust is reinforced not by a need to survive but complex [[ludic-productivity|social forms]], and so factors that damage social cohesion or a sense of community can spiral into the collapse of productive companies, slowdowns in industry and the fraying of society itself. The corrosion of social cohesion is advanced by two axes of social disease:

* Poverty and deprivation, and its symptoms of strong inequality.
* Distrust and segregation, and its symptoms of prejudice and grievance.

Where these symptoms take root, a breakdown of society follows. The Commonwealth is aware of this, and was diagnosed in plain English in the 2028 publication *Health of Commonwealth Society* by the [[Ministry of Culture]]. This document outlined the Commonwealth approach to racial harmony and integration, which has remained mostly unchanged in the decades since.

Diversity remains a strength, and Vekllei has prospered tremendously from the talent of its people. So many achievements of their society in arts, law and science have come from different ancestries that listing them all quickly becomes tedious cliche. Nativism is the enemy of their civilisation; it was nativism that spurred the Oslolan Civil War that left their society irradiated and on the brink of death; it remains nativism that inspires separatism through violence and terror.

The social management of people, and the benefits and ills of many types of people living and mixing together, is a major occupation and achievement of Vekllei government.

## The Character of Commonwealth Society

The Commonwealth has among the highest percentage of people born overseas in the world, behind only entrep√¥ts with large guest worker populations. Immigration here resembles a mosaic, with different waves of people arriving at different times. And while the country is made up of many races and cultures, they share much in common.

Many Vekllei people have a common history -- about three fourths have ancestors that were subjects (or property) of the British Empire. The remainder are mostly the same but Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The British Empire's triumph over the world, and its extended colonial domination over the Atlantic has left Vekllei with a common language, administrative tradition and some shared industry and culture. New immigrants were filtered through the [century society laws](/century-society), which effectively invited only those talented or wealthy enough to receive a tertiary education.

The Vekllei population has doubled since the war and the founding of the modern commonwealth in 2017. Bonds and connections between people have had to be renewed constantly as new people have arrived. This renewal was encouraged by the constant mixing of people in government migrant housing policy and the general deghettoisation of society as the standard of living improved.

This growth has levelled off as the century society laws were repealed and migration controls have been introduced, which has changed the nature of cohesion. Now, a sense of trust and community is derived from connections and interactions that people accumulate with their neighbours over years and decades. [Strong protections for property](/property/) in Vekllei reinforce this sense of community, because home ownership and land stewardship are a feature of their society, and their legal basis encourages people to live in and improve a single home for an extended period of time. A single home -- and a single community -- have downstream effects on an person's participation, neighbourliness and trust.

Paramount to management of cultures is that the government must be seen nation-building across ethno-religious identities rather than in service of them, and that includes potentially being in competition with them. It is more than just a recognition of a diaspora or its concerns; it comes with obligations.

In order to succeed, multicultural policy must:

* Counter ghettoisation of ethnicities around religious and cultural cores;
* Counter the reluctance to build intercultural community relations;
* Counter shallow emphasis on celebratory harmony in place of effective and meaningful conversation and cohabitation;
* Counter the emphasis on internal ethnoreligious divisions in place of intercultural perspective and priority;
* Counter punitive and inflammatory strategies and activism, even where they do not break the law.

To do so, the government must also recognise and anticipate points of friction that may encourage such behaviour, including:

*


* The problem of social cohesion and a shared identity is an ongoing issue in Vekllei.
* Interculturalism is a cornerstone of the Vekllei approach, which means mixing people.

* It is premised on the liberal ideal of the person as a free subject able to pursue their values and beliefs -- upon which the normative ideal of multiculturalism is based. In this ideal, these opportunities and rights must be universal.
* Society is constituted by overlapping realms of social capital strengthened by trust. In multicultural soceities, during conflicts with out others the social capital built within communities may be hardened, while that between groups is diluted if not almost totally dissolved. Moreover, the settlement and social integration experiences of diverse diaspora communities are likely to be affected by an absence of multigenerational social networks that would otherwise facilitate social integration, national attachment and political affiliation. This may lead to a sense of social marginalisation and disempowerment, in many cases breeding resentment and outright hostility. These are symptoms of fragile trust.

## Diversity in the Commonwealth

* wider communities where people live are comprised of people from many different backgrounds and there is little sense in which immigrant groups can ghettoise or segregated into enclaves.
* Foreign-born Commonwealth people have reasonably similar levels of trust in other people and the government as Vekllei-born people.
* Foreigners have shallower roots but their participation in society develops the longer they live here.
* Vekllei people believe it too, and a common belief in multiculturalism contributes positively to social cohesion in Vekllei.
* Crises and natural disasters have tended to strengthen rather than weaken these beliefs, and are associated with spikes in trust of government and each other.
* Commonwealth people have demonstrated a capacity to rally around and support each other through difficult times.

## Equality and its Downstream Contributions

* Economic disadvantage and deprivation have been shown to be the strongest predictors of individuals social support networks, their levels of trust, sense of belonging, and engagement in their communities. More broadly, absolute deprivation is a direct symptom of societal malfunction that leads one to question whether such deprivation can truly co-exist with social cohesion.

* Economic inequalities are a key driver of social inequalities
* Federalisation and integration with Vekllei also exacerbates existing symptoms of social fraying
* Household finances and quality of life are the single most important predictor of how people perceive cohesion.
* Poor and deprived people are much less likely to say they have a great sense of belonging in Vekllei, and have a much lower sense of happiness and self-worth. They are much less likely to trust other people or agree that multiculturalism has been good for Vekllei.
* Financial and housing security contribute substantially to Vekllei cohesion.
* Vekllei prevents high rates of immigrant turnover. Vekllei people remain most prejudiced towards immigrants from non-Anglo countries, a prejudice also held by black Caribbeans and some immigrants.

[^indigenous]: Indigenous groups in Vekllei include Algic Inuits in [[Oslola]] and [[Kala]], Sami in [[Helvasia]], Caribs in the [[kalina|Lesser Antilles]], Mayan and Central Americans in parts of the [[Antilles]], among many others.
