**Summary**

* Many Vekllei machines, including aircraft as small as helijets, are powered by nuclear reactors.
* The reasonable question is -- what about the risk? How do you repair such a large fleet of reactors?
* Furthermore, what is the risk of catastrophe -- of a meltdown or radiation leak hurting people around them?
* What happens in a crash?

What sort of thing do *lots* produce? Small factories generally produce essential products that are ubiquitous, or otherwise specialty craft items.

1. While nuclear reactors are much more prevalant in this setting they have only really entered industrial and commercial spaces. No personal automobiles, for example, have reactors. They are a regulated technology that requires a license to interact with
2. The prevalence of them varies a lot on geography and politics. Vekllei operates a lot of commercial nuclear transports because they're mostly islands surrounded by "empty" ocean. The use of them over dense inland spaces is much more restricted, so you're less likely to see helijets performing commercial service in New York, for example.
3. They are prevalent enough that regular firefighting in nuclear countries extends to nuclear response and radiation suppression. They train for it because it does happen. These are mostly small reactors but they still produce radioactivity and can melt down
4. These are commercial designs. In the context of the setting these reactors have really evolved and are much easier to build, diagnose and control. The safety all around is really improved -- for example, aircraft reactors have gyroscopes and sensors to SCRAM the reactor in the event of an accident
