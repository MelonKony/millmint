**Summary**

* [[Vekllei]] is a diverse country, and has no single fashion or sense of style.
* Nonetheless it is recognisable not for any single element but its broader democratic culture and motifs.
* Vekllei fashion, like much of its culture, is complex and contradictory. It is modest, transgressive, progressive, conservative but ultimately often returns to a set of identifiably Vekllei cultural signals.

Vekllei returns to a modest baseline, and whether that instinct is imposed internally or externally is an interesting question.
