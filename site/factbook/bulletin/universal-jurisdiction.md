**Summary**

* Indicated by its actions and diplomacy, the {{<link/vekllei>}} state does not recognise Westphalian principles of inviolable sovereignty.
* In regular diplomacy, this disbelief has little effect, and Vekllei has functional diplomatic relations with most countries in the world.
* In cases of law however, Vekllei has among the most assertive examples of concepts of universal jurisdiction in the world.
* As a consequence, Vekllei is a case study in concepts of universal jurisdiction and extraterritorial prosecution.

Vekllei law recognises a moral obligation to prosecute crimes against humanity. In this idea, certain criminal acts constitute an intolerable threat to humanity, and so have a moral imperative to be prosecuted regardless of local law or the time they were committed. Vekllei "assertive democracy" supports this idea, and to this end receives international advice on accused persons and may prosecute them in its local courts regardless of whether the offences were committed against Vekllei people.

This practice has become increasingly common since the end of the Second World War, but Vekllei parliament and courts have emphasised a more proactive role in prosecutions. In its view and practice, international law as established by the United Nations applies universally and consistently regardless of treaty or location, and so it is therefore a moral imperative of member-states to find and arrest accused persons on these principles. Historically, this has applied to persons accused of committing war crimes, genocide, torture, forced disappearances or extrajudicial killings.

To this end, Vekllei may attempt to prosecute foreign nationals living overseas, and has historically employed its intelligence apparatuses, mercenaries and foreign sympathisers to do so. Famous examples include
