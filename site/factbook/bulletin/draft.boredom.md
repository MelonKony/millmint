**Summary**

* Vekllei is an urbanised society, but lacks a consumer society.
* As a consequence, the experience of life is fundamentally altered.
* In the place of noise and stimulation is a quiet society with quiet thoughts.
* Gratitude is reinforced by experience and emphasis, aided by a cultural awareness and disposition towards spiritual fulfilment.
* These things are not the privilege of self-help books but are taught in schools and communicated through [public health](/healthcare/).

Since Vekllei's world does not have the features that characterise our 21st Century, there is no need to mitigate the worst of our distractions.
