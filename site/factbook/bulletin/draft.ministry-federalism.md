**Summary**

* Vekllei has an unusual kind of federalism
* This system delineates powers and independence from the federal government between Commonwealth (provincial) and Republican (city-state) governments
* Federalism in public expenditure in Vekllei follows similar patterns of autonomy as the rest of its system

The system of {{<link/government>}} in {{<link/vekllei>}} can be difficult to understand because it is very large, very complicated and without immediate comparison or precedent.

Vekllei is a federal country, but the precise nature of its federalism is obscured by overlapping *de jure* and *de facto* sovereignty. The state has four basic levels of sovereign administration:

1. Municipal (community self-governance)
2. Republican (Vekllei city-states)
3. Commonwealth (regional groupings of city-states)
4. Federal (the supreme "Commonwealth" government)

But even though this looks like a conventional hierarchy of administration, that appearance is misleading, because power and sovereignty are delegated unevenly and unconventionally between levels of government.

As such, Vekllei federalism looks very different depending on where you are standing. [Education](/education/), for example, is highly centralised -- it has its own [parliament](/parliaments/) and delivers a national, planned curriculum in compulsory government schools. On the other hand, republics exercise close control over their own monetary policy and revenues outside of general principles. The result is a system that appears confederal in some places and nearly unitary in others.
