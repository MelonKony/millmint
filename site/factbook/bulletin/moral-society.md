**Summary**

* The Commonwealth is a deeply multicultural country, and is home to people with ancestry in all corners of the world.
* It is also a society of tight social cohesion, famous for its trusting and codependent communities.
* Facilitating multicultural cohesion requires careful management, since cultural differences can encourage anomy, prejudice and even the proliferation of enclaves in society.
* These social ills damage trust, opportunity, prosperity and the common sense of identity.
* Consequently, administrating integration and cohabitation is a matter of national priority for their government.
* Their sober pragamatism allows Vekllei to enjoy the benefits of a diverse population while protecting the trusting nature of their society.

Vekllei is an interesting society because it functions essentially in an a true anarchistic way, in voluntarism and social labour.

It has deep roots in the social and ideological movements of the 20th Century, and resembles in many ways a communist society. But it is not communist; and in fact is not a marxist state at all.

Vekllei is a moral state; in the literal sense of the word. It resembles closely Catholic Social Teaching.

* If there were three cornerstones of Vekllei society, they would be dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity. Vekllei 'localism' is really the applied practice of subsidiarity.
* They do not beleive class war is inevitable. They have very few consistent existential beliefs.
* Vekllei internationalism resembles Catholic universalism, and in fact they elevate moral behaviour above law. Their promotion of international organisations, like the United Nations and Non-Aligned Movement, is consistent with the position of the Church.
* Vekllei internationalism, aligned closely with universalism, also refuses distinction between race, nationality, religion, political opinion or social class.
* Catholic subsidiarity (literally to 'sit behind') is akin to the structure of Vekllei federalism, not just within government but throughout society and in work.
* Vekllei affinity towards work as a moral good and social product is more closely aligned with Catholic teaching and distributism than it is class-based or transactional secular ideological analysis.
* Vekllei language in general reflects more closely social teaching than ideological political rhetoric. A preoccupation with the "common good" i.e. commonwealth and dignity is apparent throughout their society.

> Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community, so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do. For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social, and never destroy and absorb them.

* Vekllei subsidiarity, in which a strong state is able to intervene in failings of the fundamental and sovereign localism, again is in line with subsidia.

> things have come to such a pass through the evil of what we have termed "individualism" that, following upon the overthrow and near extinction of that rich social life which was once highly developed through associations of various kinds, there remain virtually only individuals and the State. This is to the great harm of the State itself; for, with a structure of social governance lost, and with the taking over of all the burdens which the wrecked associations once bore. the State has been overwhelmed and crushed by almost infinite tasks and duties.

> We have seen that this great labour question cannot be solved save by assuming as a principle that private ownership must be held sacred and inviolable. The law, therefore, should favour ownership, and its policy should be to induce as many as possible of the people to become owners

* Vekllei's georgist aspects and emphasis on stewardship and usefulness is closer to distributist private ownership than it is communalist property.

> The state has a positive moral role to play, since no society will achieve a just and equitable distribution of resources with a totally free market.[91] All people have a right to participate in the economic, political, and cultural life of society[92] and, under the principle of subsidiarity, state functions should be carried out at the lowest practical level.[93] Catholic social teaching values the role of intermediary organizations such as labour unions, community organizations, fraternal groups and parish churches.

> The encyclical Laborem exercens (1981) by Pope John Paul II describes work as key to the social question and a vocation. Work includes every form of action by which the world is transformed, shaped or maintained by humans; through work, fulfillment is achieved. To fulfill themselves, people must cooperate and work together to create a common good. Justice is the state of social harmony in which the actions of each person best serve the common good.
