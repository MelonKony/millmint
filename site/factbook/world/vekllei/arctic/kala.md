The <span class="fi fi-kala"></span> **Kala Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of {{<link/vekllei>}}, located 320km west of {{<link/oslola>}}. It is the world's largest island, and makes up the majority landmass and population centre of the {{<link/arctic>}}. It is known for its rugged, mostly arctic terrain and interior glaciers that forms the second-largest ice sheet in the world. Kala plays a major part in the history of Vekllei Inuits (often called Algics) and the population today remains majority Algic.

Two thirds of Kala is above the arctic circle, and its climate is moderated only by the Gulf Stream across its populated southwest coast. The interior forms a permanent low-pressure system that circles cold air above the country, where permanent ice sheets form and feed peripheral glaciers. Dramatic weather changes are a part of Kalan life, and seasons experience both polar night and midnight sun during the solstices. Exposed terrain is mostly covered by low-lying tundra vegetation and a few species of Atlantic Pine. Polar bears, Arctic Oxen and Reindeer can all be found there.

Settlement in Kala dates back thousands of years, but its extensive history is poorly recorded compared to the Oslolan kingdoms. The island was home to the first permanent settlements of Vekllei Inuits, who inhabited the coastline and islands around the capital of Kanek at least 3,000 years ago. Unlike {{<link/oslola>}}, Kala was not historically united under a single kingdom, and its harsh terrain prevented extensive trade between coasts. Local languages and culture on the east and west coasts are referred to in common as Kalan, but are seperate from each other, and have distinct identities.

Kala's massive, though isolated, internal area is unique across Vekllei, and the country is home to many government installations. The public service remains the largest employer in the country, and most Kalans live in a few major metropolitan areas on the southwest coast. Due to the interior permafrost, the island has been slow to develop rail infrastructure common across other Vekllei republics. Life under its arctic climate has been improved by the limitless supply of fusion power provided by a reactor completed in 2026. As a consequence, streets and rails are able to be heated in winter and kept free of deep snow. Kanek is home to several major Vekllei companies, including {{<link/national-machines>}} and {{<link/gemstone>}}. Major deposits of oil, coal, precious metals and uranium are mined there.
