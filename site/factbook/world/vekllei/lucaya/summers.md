The <span class="fi fi-summers"></span> **Republic of Summers** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the western North Atlantic, and part of the country of [[Vekllei]]. It is an island city state consisting of an archipelago of 7 main islands and about 170 charted islets and rocks, situated about 1,000km off the east coast of the United States and about 3,120km southwest of the Vekllei capital in Comet.

Summers was uninhabited when it was discovered by the Spanish in the early 16th Century, but was not settled until the wreck of the British ship *Sea Venture* stranded 150 English settlers bound for the Americas there, who named the isles Somers after their leader George Somers. Succeeding settlement included increasing numbers of free but indentured servants and slaves, including prisoners of war and Africans and American Indians trafficked in the slave trade. These groups make up the ancestry of most Summerans today, mixed with a steady influx of subjects from other parts of the British Empire in the centuries since.

The republic has a strong naval history that continues today. It has a major naval station of the [[marine|Marine Services]], and is the home port of the *Relentless* class of Battlecruiser, served at the large dockyard in the naval complex at the west end of the isles. The large naval construction and replenishment sites complement a network of naval forts, garrisons and missile emplacements. The navy is the majority employer in the republic, but the economy is supplemented by fresh produce, the civil service, and tourism from Vekllei people seeking tranquility in its beaches and quiet seaside villages. The republic is also home to a great number of poets and playwrights, whose work is often performed in the Theatre Royale in the capital. It is also home to the headquarters of major Commonwealth institutions, including [[Cosma]] and the [[Commonwealth Mint]].

Summers is one of the few Vekllei republics in which automobiles are banned by law. Although few Vekllei people own personal automobiles, very rarely are they banned altogether. The law came into effect in the early 20th Century, and has remained in place today to preserve the peace and quiet of the islands. Instead, Summerans commute via the 35km railway that runs the length of most of the archipelago. A small tram network also exists in the capital of Hamilton. Otherwise, locals get around via bicycle or scooter. Regular air service from the international airport provides a link to other parts of Vekllei.
