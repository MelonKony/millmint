The <span class="fi fi-habacoa"></span> **Habacoan Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of {{<link/vekllei>}} on the northeast periphery of the Lucayan archipelago, west of Nema and south of Lucayoneque. It is the largest island of the Lucayan Commonwealth, and is fragmented by many inlets and cays.

Comprising flat, wooded limestone islands linked by mangroves, Habacoa is sparsely populated for an island of its size. It has a fifth of the population of neighbouring Nema, and so its modest settlements are mostly spread up and down the east coast. The Habacoan Barrier Reef to its east is the third largest reef in the world, and is recognised internationally for its significance and diversity.

The Habacoan economy is municipal and agricultural, and its major employers are all institutions of Commonwealth government. The {{<link/LSRE>}} operates the National Marine Establishment in the town of Mars, and the {{<link/armed-forces>}} maintains the National Ocean Test Facility at the capital of Kipri. The republic is known for its seafood, and fishing is still the most common registered occupation on the island. This diet is supplemented by local crops of vegetables and tropical fruit.

A rail line runs from north to south on the east coast. The west and interior of the island is mostly protected by the Habacoa National Park, which has boardwalks and paths for visitors. Increasingly, the island is a popular place to dive among {{<link/vekllei>}} people, who travel from all over the country to visit its reefs. An airstrip with basic facilities is found outside the town of Mars and within the military facility in Kipri, but realistically most Habacoans transit to Nema for air journeys.
