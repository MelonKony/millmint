 The <span class="fi fi-lucaya"></span> **Lucayan Commonwealth** (*Vekllei Lucaya*) is a [constituent commonwealth](/constituents/) of {{<link/vekllei>}}, comprising the Lucayan archipelago and the North Atlantic island of {{<link/summers>}}. Neatly 700 islands make up its landmass, the majority of which fence the northwestern edge of the West Indies. They are almost all flat coral islands vulnerable to seasonal storms and hurricanes.

 The strategic position of the Lucayan archipelago as a gateway to the Caribbean Sea and Central America is reflected in its tumultuous and diverse history, throughout which it was mostly colonised by the British. It is particularly ethnically diverse for a Caribbean region, and in the postwar period has become a desirable place to live within {{<link/vekllei>}} for its climate and lifestyle.
