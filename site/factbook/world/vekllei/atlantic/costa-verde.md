The <span class="fi fi-costa-verde"></span> **Costa Verde Republic** (also *Verde*) is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] and part of the Atlantic Commonwealth. It is the largest and most populous island of the Azores archipelago, and seats the executive of the regional commonwealth. It is a narrow, verdant island of volcanic origin.

Verde was originally colonised by the Portuguese, who discovered the island in the 15th Century and established a small fishing colony thereafter. Throughout its history, Verde has been vulnerable to earthquakes and tidal waves, and the capital of Green Cape has been rebuilt several times. In the 19th Century, Verde rose to prominence as citrus traders, selling mostly to Southern Europe and the British Empire. Verde, along with the rest of the Azores, voted to secede from Portugal in the 1960s and after its interim government collapsed joined the Atlantic Federation in 1976. It inherited membership in [[Vekllei]] in 2015.

Verde enjoys a mild climate, and is renowned for its lush vegetation and scattered, lake-filled craters. Its peaks culminate in Vara Mountain at 1,100 meters above sea level. In the postwar period, its beauty and climate has seen many people from others parts of Vekllei move there.

Verde is the headquarters of the anti-Vekllei Azores Independence League, and has been responsible for attacks on police and federal buildings. They enjoy some political support in the Verde parliament but their influence has been waning.

Verde is a major producer of citrus and tea, and also exports significant amounts of pineapples and wine. Agriculture, shipbuilding and sugar refining are the primary components of its economy. It is also home to Atlantic University, the largest university in the Azores archipelago. The republic's settlements are connected by both passenger and freight rail as well as trams.
