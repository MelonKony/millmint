The <span class="fi fi-velas"></span> **Velas Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of {{<link/vekllei>}} in the Atlantic Ocean, in the middle of the Azores archipelago. It is a striking island of equal peculiarity and beauty, shaped long and thin and resembling a mountain range rising directly from the ocean. Its unique landmass indicates its origins atop a volcanic fissure between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, and measures 55km long from east to west.

At only 7km across at its widest point, there is little flat land available for settlement on the island. The island is famous for its *fajas*, flat areas of coastline backed by steep cliffs that are formed by lava flows meeting the sea. Many Velas towns are crowded into these little fajas, and the rest are mostly found in the hilly tops of the range that runs the length of the island.

In about the middle of the island, the land begins to rise and peaks in a sequence of volcanic craters in various stages of volcanic activity. The highland plateau, as it is called, is comparatively flat and give the island its characteristic tabletop relief. A lot of agriculture is performed up here, indulging its rich volcanic soils to grow wine and raise livestock. Its port towns are more developed and are where you'll find the government, hospitals and schools.

Despite its small population, the republic's historical isolation has allowed the proliferation of many unique traditions and customs. The island has a strong religious character, and has several religious festivals and pilgrimages that take place throughout the year. Velatians are not just pious, however -- they love to feast and dance, and are famous for the quality of their wines, cheeses and seafood. Life there is provincial and family and community is deeply important. Many Velatians live on homesteads and may only visit towns once a week.

Transport is around the republic is complicated by its dramatic terrain. A rail line, beginning in the capital, rises with the highland plateau and heads southeast. Along the way, at each station, steep funiculars provide access to the *fajas* that dot the isolated coast. The republic does not have an airport, and is connected to the rest of the {{<link/atlantic>}} Commonwealth by ferry.

Velatians speak Portuguese, but those in the towns can communicate in English serviceably. They do not receive many outsiders compared to their neighbouring republics, but interest in tourism in the republic has been stirred by its wine and some inns operate busily in the winter, mostly in the capital and the highlands.
