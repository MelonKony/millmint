The <span class="fi fi-cavoada"></span> **Cavoada Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic, off the coast of the African Sahara. It is part of the [[verde|Commonwealth Verde]] island group and Commonwealth, situated between the republics of Viana and Sal. It is a striking island of complex, moonlike terrain and conspicuous relief, dominated by the peak of Monte Gordo from which you can see the entire archipelago on a clear day.

The island is long and thin, and shaped like a fishhook. Like much of the archipelago, it is dry and temperate, with low coastal land lying barren and treeless. As the terrain climbs into dramatic hills and ranges, shrubs and trees appear. The tops and slopes of mountains are quite lush and spectacularly pretty. The republic is famous for its narrow valleys that snake through the interior of the island.

The island, like the rest of the archipelago, was uninhabited when it was discovered by the Portuguese in the mid-15th Century. It was not permanently settled until over 100 years later, because the previous settlement of *Porto de Lapa* was abandoned after pirate attacks. Long known as the birthplace of Verdean culture, the island is famous for its poets and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It also served as an important refueling station for whaling vessels headed south.

Cavoadan people are reserved and have a strong sense of culture and independence. The Commonwealth has constructed several intercity trams that wind through the mountainous interior of the island at great expense, but many locals still prefer to get around on horseback. Tarrafal Secondary School, the largest of its kind in the republic, has a stable for students arriving on horses.

The republic is best known for its pretty, pastel-coloured homes and square terraced gardens that are rich with local produce -- mostly coffee, oranges and mandarins. There is a deep sense of spirituality there, and not just because it is the seat of the Verdean archdiocese -- the otherworldly beauty of its weathered and ostentatious mountains encourage reverence towards the land. The capital of Tarrafal is dry and coastal, framed by a massive valley behind it. The city of Ribeira Brava is green and follows the slope of the mountains downhill, and competes with any town of the *Cinque Terre* for beauty. A rail line connects the two cities with each other and the only airport, but only a few other settlements are accessibly by tram. The distant, small communities on the coasts are only accessible by boat or horseback.

Most of the economy comprises municipal goods, smallholdings and culture. For an island of its size it produces a suprising amount of poetry, inspired by the landscape of the republic and its strong sense of isolation. A lot of coffee, oranges and maize is grown, and the surplus is generally exported. The capital has a good natural harbour, through which most other goods are imported. Ferries depart there for neighbouring islands in the archipelago.
