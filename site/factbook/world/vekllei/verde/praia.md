The <span class="fi fi-praia"></span> **Praia Republic** (literally "Beach") is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic, and is located in the southeastern fringe of the Barlavento archipelago. Perhaps a better name might have been 'Plateau,' since its characteristic and most charismatic feature are its raised towns and villages raised on pleateaus surrounded by valleys. It is both an unusual and extraordinarily pretty island reflected well in its distinctive and insular culture.

For an island of its size, Praia remains surprisingly provincial. Neighbouring republics of the [[Verde|Verde Commonwealth]] have large federal or international institutions -- the [[NTLU]] in [[Sal]], or the International Peace Park on [[Maio]], for example. But despite being the most populous of the Barlavento islands, Praia seems to administrate only itself. This is despite its welcoming culture, developed coastal cities and pleasant climate, and makes it both an oddity and oddly charming in Vekllei's disparate Commonwealth. It is also heavily forested, especially in its valleys and mountains, which is unusual for the region.

Praia is the administrative heart of eastern [[Verde]] and the seat of its federal garrison. Unlike [[Cavoada]]'s dramatic mountainous interior or [[Viana]]'s natural harbor, Praia was never destined for greatness by geography alone. Its selection as the Verde capital in 1858 was a case of political pragmatism over natural advantage, chosen precisely because it offended no established interests while offering the practical benefit of defensible highlands overlooking excellent anchorage. The massive Fortaleza do Plateau (now [[Fortress Praia]], built in phases between 1860 and 1895) remains the most imposing structure in the republic and has completely absorbed the islet of Santa Maria it once sat atop in the capital's harbour.

The island's Portuguese colonial period left the usual scars of slave entrep√¥ts and salt pans, but Praia's independent character emerged during the great morna renaissance of the 1880s, when Verdean musicians fleeing drought found patronage among the Portuguese colonial bureaucrats and garrison officers who had begun to see their Atlantic posting as something more than exile. "Plateau Sessions" -- informal concerts held in the fortress courtyards during the cooler evening hours -- remain a distinctive tradition to this day, and draw musicians from as far as the Azores who contribute to an evolved "federal morna" style. Today's visitor will still find echoes of the Portuguese colonial period in the caf√©s surrounding Government House, where retired functionaries with ancestry in three continents argue about federal this-or-that over grogue and past√©is.

The republic's unique position as the archipelago's administrative center has preserved Verdean traditions amidst a growing, cosmopolitan population -- a certain measured dignity, an appreciation for bureaucratic elegance, and the peculiar pride that comes from being simultaneously provincial and federally significant. The capital, also called Praia, is well-developed and home to many tall buildings, including the federal fortress and the headquarters of the Commonwealth Maritime Register. They are proud of their underground metro, the only such example in Verde, which feeds into winding and scenic train lines that reach out to the republic's mountain towns and villages. A fast train leaves regularly for Tarrafal, the other city of the republic.
