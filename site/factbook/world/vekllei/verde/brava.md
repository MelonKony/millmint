The <span class="fi fi-brava"></span> **Brava Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic, found at the southern tip of the inward crescent of the Cabo Verde archipelago. It is the smallest island of the archipelago, and is much greener than its neighbours. It measures about 10km across, and its silhouette is dominated by Monte Fontainhas, which slopes down to a coastline largely fringed by cliffs.

Only about 15,000 people live there, and most of them live in the capital of Nova Sintra. The town was originally settled on the coast, but was forced inland by regular pirate raids that devastated early life there. Many Bravans are descended from neighbouring Fogo, and fled after much of the island was overcome by lava floes in the late 17th Century. In the 18th Century, the island mostly exported textile dyes, and also served as an important port for whaling operations around the Azores and Canary island groups.

Like many Verdean islands, the sharp volcanic relief of Brava fosters a diverse climate despite its small size. The interior of the mountain is substantially wetter and cooler than the coasts, and the peak of Monte Fontainhas is often cloaked in clouds. Although the mountain is volcanic, it has not erupted in thousands of years, though the island is still struck by earthquakes that indicate its shifting topology. Several islets surround the main island, but all of them are uninhabited.

Most Bravans live in Nova Sintra, a pretty and terraced town that grows a lot of coffee and oranges. The only secondary school on the island is located there, as is its only hospital. The main port of the republic is located some ways north in the town of Furna, which is especially pretty. A cable tram line runs from Furna to the capital and onwards towards two distant towns. There are some abandoned settlements in the south and east of the island, mostly comprising former plantations or villages that were depopulated over time. There is a brewery in the capital that produces a unique local beer, infused with orange peel.

Outside of the city centre, most homes on the island are homesteads and practice municipal agriculture. There is a small seafood processing factory in Furna but otherwise no major industry to speak of in the republic outside of municipal goods and the civil service. There are also no airports in the republic, which is scored by vicious winds. Ferries leave from Furna each day for Fogo and Praia.
