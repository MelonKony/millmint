The <span class="fi fi-sal"></span> **Sal Republic** (literally "Salt") is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Atlantic, and is the northeasternmost island of the Barlavento archipelago. It comprises a main island shaped roughly like a fish and a tiny, uninhabited islet of its west coast. The republic is particularly flat and dry, and much of its surface is made of red, sandy dirt exposed to trade winds. It is fringed by pretty beaches of white sand, and receives an extraordinary amount of sun per year.

The island was sparsely populated throughout much of the early colonial period, but drew permanent settlement after the establishment of a salt works near the modern settlement of Pedra Lume. This spurred a "salt rush" that saw the island's population grow rapidly. Other major settlements, including the capital of Santa Maria, are the legacy of the salt industry, which is mostly clustered around shallow, extinct volcanic craters. Although the industry saw significant decline during the 20th Century as major export markets were closed off by foreign protectionism, most of the major factories survive under municipal management in [[Vekllei]], and the republic is the largest domestic exporter of salt in the country.

The history of the republic contributes to its unique appearance today. Its major towns, including the capital, are quite pretty Portuguese colonial settlements improved by irrigation of street trees and municipal agriculture in the federal period. Outside of these dense communities is a wide, flat expanse of land without any major features except for salt ponds, their factories, and aerial tramways that criss-cross the island with buckets full of salt. Outside of the cities and their gardens, the republic is mostly treeless and barren.

Santa Maria and the historic fishing village of Palmeira are particularly beautiful. The locals are a mix of local Verdeans and Persian migrants, mostly refugees from the first failed Jungle Coup in Iran. Persians are about half the population and practice culturally muslim traditions but are not especially devout. The salt industry is heavily automated, so most Salians work in research or academia.

There is a very pretty mosque in the capital, but the major attraction of the republic is the [National Levantine Theological University](/nltu/) (NLTU). This is a sprawling complex starting on the hilltop of Monte Curral in the centre of the island, and it cascades down its slopes to cover about forty acres. It is the largest theological institution in the country, with a special focus on ancient Abrahamic religious history (primarily Coptic, Roman Catholic, Syriac and Antioch Christians, Mizrahi Jews, Shia Islam, and Zoroastrianism). The modernist fusion style of its campus is particularly acclaimed, and unlike internationalist styles is heavily ornamented and decorated. It is among the most prestigious institutions of its type in the world, and has about 6,000 domestic and international students in addition to 3,000 permanent staff. Flowing water and canals characterise not just the NLTU but Santa Maria as well, and provide passive cooling.

Salians live in the handful of towns across the island, the largest of which is the capital. A lot of work is related to the NLTU in some way, either as writers, artists, academics or providing services like cooking or board for students. Despite their proximity to the university, they are typically sleepy towns with little nightlife. The salt works are the major export industry on the island, and fishing supplements the local diet. Their religion and customs are divided mostly evenly between the Verdean and Persian communities, which mix freely. Swimming in the salt craters are a popular novelty for resident students.

A train connects Santa Maria to the university, and proceeds onwards to the towns of Palmeira and Pedra Lume. The island is somewhat poorly connected by ferries compared to other Verde islands, lending the republic an insular quality. An airport is located just outside of Santa Maria, which accommodates international connections to the university.
