<span class="fi fi-com"></span> **Vekllei** is best conceptualised as a union of islands across the Atlantic Ocean. It is a commonwealth,[^commonwealth] the fourth in a series, and consists of many island republics that are connected by politics and prosperity, not geography or race. It is a new kind of country, without direct precedence or comparison, and spans the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans in their entirety.

The Commonwealth which unites them is both deeply federal and highly standardised, and built on common systems of governance and economic management. The sovereign basis of the country is the [republic](/republics/), or island city-state, which are organised into regional [constituent commonwealths](/constituents/). These republics, numbering 78 in total, cede aspects of governance like [[Healthcare]], [[Education]] and the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] to the federal Commonwealth.

The capital of Vekllei is [Comet](/comet/), located west of the Azores Commonwealth in the Meteor Islands. It was designed and built for that purpose.

Vekllei is often regarded a nation by will, rather than of culture or geography. It consists of distant autonomous republics with many cultures and languages, and it has attracted millions of immigrants since independence looking to participate in building the unique aspects of its governance and society.

> Oslola, raging and now blinded, drew deep wounds into the Earth. Out of these wounds came fire, and out of fire came her child Oslola.

-- Retelling of Algic legends, Verse 40, *Saga of Origins*

<details>
  <summary>What is Vekllei?</summary>
Vekllei is a country that consists of many island republics in the Atlantic. The largest of these is called [[Oslola]], which is its most populous island. Vekllei is the setting of this fiction, and is the home of most of its characters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where is Vekllei?</summary>
Most of Vekllei's islands are found in the North Atlantic and Caribbean seas. Its northernmost territory is [[Helvasia]] (Svalbard) and its southernmost territories are on the Antarctic continent. It also has a claim on the moon.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When was Vekllei founded?</summary>
The Commonwealth of Oceans (Vekllei) was founded in 2017 after independence in 2015, and is the 4th in a succession of historic Commonwealths based in the Kalan and Oslolan Islands. The first, known as the Nord Commonwealth, was the world's first parliament and among the first democracies in the world.
</details>

## Name

The country is known by different names. On this website, it is called [[Vekllei]], which is an Algic [corcidi](/corcidi/) word meaning *people of the sea and stars*.[^name] Within the country, 'Vekllei' usually refers to the federal government.

The formal title of the country is the *Commonwealth of Oceans*, but is rarely used. It is more commonly known as the *Atlantic Commonwealth* or *[Veletian](/veletia/) Commonwealth*. In most cases, including internationally, the country is simply called the 'Commonwealth.' Most people identify themselves by their native [republic](/republics/), but together people may call themselves 'Vekllei' as plural, or 'Veletian.'

## History

{{<note>}}
The diversity of the Commonwealth is reflected in its history. Vekllei as we know it today may have roots in in the Oslola-Kalan Union and Kalina nationalism, but its story begins in 1995, during the First Atomic War and British occupation of its former colonial territories for 20 years. That occupation, and the complete restructuring of Atlantic society beneath it, lay the foundations for a new and pluralistic union of republics called Vekllei.

{{</note>}}

Many Commonwealth republics have been inhabited for thousands of years, and have cultures and traditions that encompass many unique languages and faiths. There is a strong collision of old and new everywhere in the country. On many islands, ancient bloodlines and traditions have been displaced by colonial enterprise or postwar migration.

In many ways, the story of Vekllei is a story of slavery and subjugation. All of its republics were once European colonies, and most were transformed by chattel slavery. In many republics, indigenous populations were enslaved or murdered. Such is the basic tension in the heart of the country -- a direct successor to cultures with thousands of years of history, but profoundly influenced by colonial enterprise and the modern world.

The federal system of the country has precedence in the Oslolan Commonwealths that existed sporadically between 700 AD and 1600 AD. For this reason, Vekllei is sometimes referred to as the "4th Commonwealth," a phrase that draws a direct connection between Vekllei and the Oslolan Commonwealths.[^4th]

The Oslolan North Sea Empire forms an important part of the country's hsitory, as its historic centre of population and industry. Many early Atlantic federalists were Oslolan, and in many ways the genesis of the federal republic originates there. To this day, [[Oslola]] remains the most developed Vekllei republic, and dwarfs the others in size and industry. Federal principles have decentralised much of Vekllei administration, but most of its industry remains in [[Oslola]] and [[Kairi]].

Common history of Vekllei as a state begins in 1710 AD, when the North Sea Empire comprising [[Oslola]] and [[Kala]] capitulated to the Kingdom of Great Britain and became subjects the British Empire. In 1836, the British colonies in the Atlantic were reincorporated as the British Atlantic Territories. This colony was granted autonomy in 1838 and achieved dominion status in 1926, and lay the groundwork for Oslolan independence in 1935.

After the Second World War, the Oslolan Republic struggled through a series of crises that culminated in the fall of government and the establishment of the Atlantic Council in 1963, which severed ties with the UK. Rising territorial ambitions and erratic council rule saw relations strained and culminated in the Oslolan Civil War in 1992 and the exchange of nuclear weapons with the UK in 1995.

[[oslola|Oslolan]] territories, including [[Kala]], [[Demon]] and [[Helvasia]] were occupied between 1995 and 2017. Independence was granted in 2015, in which occupied territories ceded local rule to a union called the Atlantic Commonwealth. This Commonwealth is the foundation of modern Vekllei.

The accession of other republics occurred between 2020 and 2040, and continues to this day in a process known as [federalisation](/federalisation/). Rather than individual islands, these accessions involved sovereign island-groups like the West Indies Federation, the Azores and Cabo Verde which were then decentralised by the Commonwealth. There are 78 constituent republics in Vekllei today.

## State

{{<note>}}
Vekllei contains a lot of ideas colliding with each other, which break into fragments and fuse to create new elements. This is a result of its similarly chaotic history, uniting a patchwork of republics that have been subjugated by other powers over time. These elements have evolved to become a new kind of nation-state, unique in the world and history.
{{</note>}}

The Commonwealth is a union of Atlantic and Caribbean islands which, freed from colonial rule, have established a federal system to share common burdens and improve the lives of their oceangoing peoples. It is a constitutional, federal country comprising 78 republics which share political features established by the [Council of Roses](/rose-council/). These principles are enshrined in their [Civil Rights](/rights/).

Vekllei has a unique kind of federalism, with republics and territories orbiting central Commonwealth control at different distances. A common means of petitioning membership, or "acceding" to the Commonwealth is via its international organisation called [[COMOC]].

Although a country of unparalleled geographic and cultural diversity, Vekllei administration is [strongly standardised](/bulletin/standardisation/) and the state functions as a single, contiguous country. Its constituent republics have large degrees of autonomy, but are unilaterally governed by the federal government as an intact state.

</details>

The Commonwealth is a country of unequaled geographic and natural diversity. It spans the entirety of the Atlantic as well as the Caribbean Sea, and comprises the majority of islands within both. Its frontiers resemble the extremes of a compass -- [[Helvasia]] in the north, [[Sude]] in the south, [[Principe]] in the east and [[Caimanas]] in the west. Between them lie thousands of Vekllei islands and reefs, and two oceans. The exclusive economic zones of its islands are many times greater than the landmass of the islands themselves, and protect a wealth of resources and fish stocks.

There are 78 Vekllei republics, which comprise the 78 main inhabited islands in the country. There are thousands of other islands, islets and rocks that make up its territory. Vekllei also maintains claims on both poles, and maintains lunar and martian settlements.

In total, Vekllei islands amount to a demonstration of earth's biodiversity. Xeric plains, arctic deserts, flower-tundras, dense jungles, temperate rainforests, pastoral hills and coral sandbanks can all be found there. Spanning pole to pole, this country experiences the extremes of polar midnight sun and humid, equatorial storms at the same time. Among them are the world's largest islands and among its smallest, ranging from the republic of [[Kala]] of over 830,000 square miles to [[Saba]] of just 5. Many other possessions amount to little more than surfaced sea mounts, reefs and rocks.

Across its archipelagoes are a broad sample of people from every corner of the world -- Europeans, Africans, indigenous Inuits, Caribbean Indians, Persians, South-East Asians, Mediterraneans and Mongols all make their homes in Vekllei. A half-century of immigration has ensured that every language on earth is represented. The living effect is unique -- a social internationalism wrought from all kinds of people in all kinds of environments.

### Government

{{<note advice>}}
Main article: [[Government]]
{{</note>}}

The Vekllei government plays an active role in the lives of ordinary people. Each commonwealth republic is represented by two people[^ministers] of equal standing called Prime Ministers. These ministers represent the bicameral parliaments and assembled cabinets of their homes,[^sorda] and participate equally in a council of leaders called the [[directory|Commonwealth Directory]].

There are different levels of elected government in Vekllei.

1. The *Vekllei Commonwealth* is the federal governing body and parliament of the [constituent republics](/constituents/). The head of state is the [[council|Commonwealth Council]]. The [Commonwealth Senate](/senate/) has special powers to approve or reject legislation.
2. The *National Commonwealths* are constituent republics that manage home affairs with devolved powers. They each have [National Assemblies](/assembly/) which propose legislation.
3. The *Polis o Democros* ([Republics](/polis/)) are city republics, areas or boroughs that manage local services. [Territories](/territories/) in Vekllei are also governed by Municipal Commonwealths.

Vekllei elections do not allow political parties, a system called *nonpartisan democracy*. Commonwealth [ministries](/ministries/) and [council secretariats](/councils/) are lead by professional directors appointed by an internal vote, and final approval resting with the [[directory|Commonwealth Directory]].

### Economy
{{<note panel >}}
The Vekllei economy exists in two pieces: as a social market, dominated by wandering interest and cooperation, and as a financial market, which subsidises the former. The moneylessness of the social market is the marvel of the Vekllei nation and is deeply revered by citizens and disaffected foreign ideologues alike.
{{</note>}}

{{<note advice>}}
See also: *[A Social Economy](/social-economy/)*
{{</note>}}

The Commonwealth has a hybrid moneyless system called *commons*, in which money is not used in daily life. In the place of money, the commons system exists as a series of social economies and usufructs. Rather than purchasing products as consumers, staples like food and clothing are subsidised by groups of companies known as [*bureaus*](/bureaus/). Everything else is produced in the colloquial moneyless market, often unreliably.

Money is used in a seperate industrial and financial market called the *financialised commons*. In this market, Vekllei has two currencies known as [*Vekllei*](/factbook/society/state/finance/#vekllei-crown-vk) and [*Government Crowns*](/factbook/society/state/finance/#government-crown-ak), which are used by the government, industry and foreigners to interact with the Vekllei economy and purchase securities and financial instruments. Money is also used as a means of exchange between Commonwealth republics as a privilege of the state.

The country has maintained high unemployment since independence, sliding between 5-10% for most of the postwar period.

The commons economy relies on a system of participatory work, encouraged by the simple and universal rule to be employed, called [Consosva](/consosva/). The standard of living in Vekllei is quite good and is unique among modern societies today.

In industrialised regions like [[Oslola]], the *commons* has a sophisticated network of incentives and social engineering to facilitate its quality of life. In other regions, particularly scattered across the many archipelagos and small islands of the Commonwealth, self-sufficiency is more common and dependent on fishing, community and codependence.

#### Work

Employment in Vekllei has many unique features, not least of which is its functional moneylessness. Except for Verde,[^transition] no republic of the Commonwealth uses money in daily life. Work in Vekllei is characterised by lifetime employment and seniority-based advancement, though this culture is changing in some industries. Most larger businesses in Vekllei function as cooperatives, often as part of a [Bureau](/bureaus/).

![Image of Tzipora and strangers waiting for a tram on a misty day](/images/fullres/tram.jpg "Life is not that different, but is improved in ordinary and meaningful ways. People still go to school and work, as depicted here | *[Anarchist Trams](/stories/trams/)*")

This work environment ranks highly for [productivity](/bulletin/productivity/) but lowly for economic freedom, as the structure of the commons inhibits scaling businesses beyond social dimensions. Private business ownership is most common in small communities with strong social bonds, particularly in rural or agricultural areas.

Vekllei people generally have aspirations of power rather than wealth, and work towards that goal in the absence of a wage. Other reasons for work include its strong social dimensions and relaxed ethic, which are facilitated by a professional but gentle work culture that retains short working days and frequent tea breaks.

#### Finance

{{<note advice>}}
Main article: <span class="smallicon">üíµ</span> *[Finance in Vekllei](/finance/)*
{{</note>}}

Vekllei separates its markets to allow for money to be used by industry and the government as part of trade and business.

* **The Commons** is the moneyless and participatory domestic market.
* **The Financialised Commons** are the moneyed industrial and international markets.


Most Vekllei people never interact with the financialised commons, but it plays a significant role in the economy. Vekllei's history as a series of entrep√¥ts and its international neutrality have made it desirable as a place of business and investment, and many foreign companies bank in Vekllei. Vekllei is a major commodities and securities exchange, via the [Vekllei International Market](/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets).

Despite its international investment and low barriers to trade, the Commonwealth government is a major participant in the financialised commons and contributes significantly to its currency pool. Vekllei has the second-largest foreign currency reserves in the world.

The Commonwealth has major financial hubs in Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Azores.

#### Industry

{{<note advice>}}
Main article: <span class="smallicon">‚öôÔ∏è</span> *[Industry](/industry/)*
{{</note>}}
{{<note advice>}}
Read more: <span class="smallicon">üè¨</span> *[State Industry in Vekllei](/state-industry/)*
{{</note>}}

Vekllei has a large industrial capacity and produces vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles, and processed foods. It has the 12th-highest manufacturing output in the world.

Parts of Vekllei are highly industrialised,[^industrialised] and the country has modernised its economy since independence through labour-saving automations, centralisation and new technologies like [robotics](/computers/). Very few Vekllei people work in traditional factory labour, since it is impractical in the [commons](/vekllei/#economy), and so most production and assembly occurs in automated factories known as [*lots*](/bulletin/lots/).

Major industries in Vekllei leverage the creative productivity of its enthusiastic and well-educated population, and leads markets in financial services, design, banking, electronics, telecommunications and research. Its historic reputation as a reliable and efficient entrep√¥t and geographic diversity means Vekllei is a major hub of trade and is well-connected to the rest of the world.

#### Property

{{<note advice>}}
Read more: <span class="smallicon">üè°</span> *[Property in Vekllei](/housing/)*
{{</note>}}

The right to property is protected by the [Vekllei Constitution](/constitution/), and important in North Vekllei culture. Home ownership is a foundation of [Atlantic Municipalism](/municipalities/), and is determined by stewardship of land.

In the Vekllei legal system, land has three competing agents:

* The Steward -- the occupier and worker of the land
* The Public -- the community, municipality and state
* The Sovereign -- the land itself, as a seperate sovereign kingdom of nature

Rather than defined legal owners, land ownership in Vekllei is a pluralistic competition between these three agents. The claim to ownership grows with time and use, and so it is possible for any agent to litigate property provided a reasonable claim to ownership can be provided.

In North Vekllei, where [Upen](/upen/) folk metaphysics are practiced, the Sovereign is treated literally as a competing agent. In other parts of Vekllei, like the Kalina Isles, it is treated as nature itself or the environment. In both cases, the interests of the Sovereign are established by special prosecutors in court.

Nearly 96% of Vekllei people own their homes, among the highest rates of home-ownership in the world.

### Foreign Policy

Vekllei has championed the nonalignment movement since independence. Situated between NATO powers (North America and Western Europe) and between exploited developing regions (South America and West Africa), the Commonwealth uses nonalignment simultaneously as an instrument of peace and intervention. It has close relations with other nonaligned countries, including Yugoslavia and India.

This historical neutrality and geographic accessibility has encouraged the founding and relocation of international organisations to Vekllei. Vekllei chairs the [Council of Oceans](/oceans-council/) and has many international organisations headquartered across its republics, including the International Federation of Journalists and the new United Nations Office.

Many Vekllei people work overseas for a period of time, either individually or as part of Commonwealth-sponsored programmes. The country is among the largest exporters of doctors and teachers in the world, many of whom work in West and Southern Africa.

The Commonwealth has several disputed territories among its Constituents and territories, particularly the Falkland Islands with Argentina and the Antilles Commonwealth with Venezuela.

### Military

{{<note advice>}}
Main article: [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]]
{{</note>}}

The Commonwealth has a large military and takes an active role in a variety of conflicts around the world. It is separated into a large conscripted militia, for which all citizens receive training, and a professional armed forces. Its professional armed forces have an expeditionary character and consist of small, highly mobile units deployable to developing regions overseas.

Vekllei has a large domestic arms industry and produces most of its equipment internally, with significant spending on research. It also exports large numbers of arms to foreign nations, particularly members of the nonaligned movement.

Recent conflicts include the 2045 intervention in Haiti and the 2065 Congo Crisis.

Vekllei is a nuclear power and maintains a network of ICBM silos and air-deployable nuclear weapons as part of deterrence.

## Society

Commonwealth society is multicultural, egalitarian, informal and pluralistic. Aspects of society can be closely controlled by government or anarchistic, depending on circumstance. Vekllei has a strong sense of civic identity based around [Atlantic Municipalism](/municipalities/) and Floral Democracy.

Although acknowledging its indigenous cultures, postwar society in Vekllei emphasises a broad esprit de corps that informs belief through common values and political practices.

![Image of Tzipora and strangers waiting for a tram on a misty day](/images/fullres/sack.jpg "Life is not that different, but is improved in ordinary and meaningful ways. People still go to school and work, as depicted here | *[Anarchist Trams](/stories/trams/)*")

Commonwealth society is internationalist owing to its internal distance and diversity, and so aspects of its political and cultural beliefs are considered universal. Atlantic Laicity overrules religious practice where it violates Commonwealth values or law -- for example the wearing of long veils in schools and public institutions is prohibited. Similarly, the Commonwealth considers democracy to be a foundational human right and belief in it is essential for participation in society.

Because the unmoneyed *Commons* economy is essentially unregulated beyond the [Vekllei Basic Laws](/basic-laws/), Commonwealth society has strong anarchist currents.

### Education

{{<note advice>}}
Main article: <span class="smallicon">üìö</span> *[Education in Vekllei](/education/)*
{{</note>}}

Education in Vekllei is universal and compulsory for children until the age of 16. All schools are coeducational, with the exception of a handful of [faith schools](/factbook/society/state/education/#faith-schools).

Education across the Commonwealth is considered a life-long affair, and the country has many public programmes to encourage adult learning. The quality and universality of Vekllei education has ensured universal literacy across the Commonwealth and is a major export, both as a business and as a form of diplomacy and aid.

### Demographics
{{<note advice>}}
Read more: <span class="smallicon">üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶</span> *[Demographics of Vekllei](/demographics/)*
{{</note>}}

24 million people live in Vekllei, and about half of them were born overseas. This number has settled in the mid-21st century, and is growing only slightly.

Due to the unique geographic make-up of the country, Vekllei is highly centralised across a handful of major cities on its most populous islands and archipelagos. This population is also highly urbanised due to contemporary [housing policy](/housing/).

The Commonwealth is often described as a "cultural mosaic" because of its diverse linguistic and cultural groups. Immigration was encouraged as part of the [Century Society](/century-society/) laws, and resulted in the population of the Commonwealth increasing by nearly 8 million people between 2015 and 2050. Combined with the membership of new [Constituents](/constituents/) during this time, the population of the Commonwealth has doubled since independence.

As a pluralistic society, a national civic identity called [Civic Commons](/civic-commons/) is promoted by the government as a means to foster social cohesion. As a nation by will rather than by circumstance, Vekllei has a strong national identity and the Vekllei diaspora[^diaspora] feel strongly towards the country.

#### Ancestry & Immigration
{{<note advice>}}
Read more: <span class="smallicon">‚öñÔ∏è</span> *[Century Society Laws](/century-society/)*
{{</note>}}

Millions of migrants have settled in Vekllei. They arrived primarily from the territories of the former British and Portuguese empires, but large indigenous populations exist in Oslola, Kalina, the Antilles and Principe.

### Language

Vekllei has 16 official unique languages, a result of its unique communities and decentralised geography. It has an official constructed language, called Veletian, and English is widely spoken and understood. English, Veletian and a local language are generally taught in schools, and it is not uncommon for Vekllei people to speak three or four languages.

### Religion

Vekllei is agonistic and has no official religion, but recognises and has protections for traditional and folk religions. Recognised traditional faiths include folk Oslolan spiritualism, Kalina local faiths and the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religions.

Religion plays a role in certain Commonwealth societies, affecting local holidays and days of rest. In societies with large folk religions like Oslola and Kalina, aspects of local faith are present in the structure of municipal government and public companies.

Although the official position of the Commonwealth is as a lay, secular republic that forbids public worship in state institutions like schools and government, it is loosely enforced.

### Transport

{{<note advice>}}
Read more: [[CommRail]]
{{</note>}}

The Commonwealth has a comprehensive common transit network, which makes up most commuter traffic in the country. Automobiles are uncommon, except in the lending of "company cars" or via community Autopools. Most of the Vekllei republics are serviced by a dense network of trains and trams, and connected to each other via ferries, passenger jets and helijets.

![Image of a space plane on a runway](/images/lightbulb.jpg "Public transport infrastructure ranges from local tramways to lunar spaceflight | *[A Vekllei Spaceship](/stories/lightbulb/)*")

Public transit ranges from state-of-the-art maglev lines in [[Oslola]] to century-old steam locomotives in Verde, operated by [Vekllei National Rail](/rail/). The sophistication of the network allows almost any citizen of the Commonwealth to travel from their doorstep to the moon entirely via public transport.

### Communications

{{<note advice>}}
Read more: <span class="smallicon">üñ•</span> *[Computing in Vekllei](/factbook/society/technology/computers/)*
{{</note>}}

The Commonwealth is the site of the Atlantic Telephone & Telegraph Exchange, which services connections between the Americas and Europe. It has a sophisticated network of public phones available to persons with a Phone Card. Radio and television broadcasting are operated by the Ministry of the Commons via the Commonwealth Radio and Commonwealth Television companies, which contract regional service to local operators.

The Commonwealth maintains the National Bulletin System, a form of networked electronic bulletin board that is able to be accessed from most libraries and schools across its republics.<span class="tombstone">

<hr>

[^commonwealth]: Commonwealths are a historical nation-state indigenous to some [Constituents](/constituents/), and today distinguishes Vekllei from federalised or unitary states and emphasises their egalitarian values and shared future.
[^name]: The *corcidi* is actually a combination of two poetic phrases, and is usually transliterated separately as *people of the sea, people of the stars*, though the meaning is the same.
[^4th]: The Vekllei Commonwealth celebrates pan-atlanticism and strongly rejects historic connections to any one nation-state. For this reason, the phrase "4th Commonwealth" is controversial and sometimes associated with Oslolan Scandinavian nationalists.
[^member-states]: "Member-states" refers to territorial membership in the Commonwealth, either as full [Constituents](/constituents/) or [Territories](/territories/).
