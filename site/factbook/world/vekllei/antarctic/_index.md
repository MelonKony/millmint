<span class="fi fi-antarctic"></span> Commonwealth Antarctica (*Vekllei Antarctica*) is a [constituent commonwealth](/constituents/) of {{<link/vekllei>}}, comprising largely isolated and scattered island [republics](/republics/) in the south Atlantic and Antarctic oceans. It is the least-populated and least-developed of the regional commonwealths, and its republics are dependent on small trades, fishing, and Vekllei Commonwealth institutions like the military and civil service.

Commonwealth Antarctica extends from the {{<link/santes>}} and {{<link/sude>}} Republics in the Antarctic Ocean to {{<link/ascension>}} just below the equator. Compared to other commonwealths, it has vast internal distances between sparse and isolated island republics. It includes desert and temperate islands like {{<link/ascension>}} and {{<link/helena>}}, as well as barren and wind-worn rocks in the Antarctic.

Commonwealth Antarctica occupies a strategic position in the South Atlantic, and bolsters the Vekllei claims on the antarctic continent. Many of its republics host air bases or naval stations that support Vekllei sovereignty over nearly the entire Atlantic Oceans, from Arctic to Antarctic.
