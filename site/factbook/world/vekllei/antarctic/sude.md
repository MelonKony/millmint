The <span class="fi fi-gs"></span> **Sude Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and part of {{<link/antarctica>}}. Its closest neighbour is the {{<link/falklands>}}, which lies 1,300km northwest of the island group. It is a cold, barren territory with permanent snow across much of its land area, and is home to a few thousand people, hardy grasses, and introduced reindeer. It comprises the island of Georgia, where nearly all of its people live, and the Candlemas island chain to its south of around 11 islands.

Historically the main island of Georgia was used by the British and Norwegians as stations for whaling and blubber rendering, and most of these former stations form the core of the seven towns on the most populous island of Georgia. The capital, Godthul, was originally a Norwegian station founded in the early 20th Century, but whales have not been hunted around Sude for over a hundred years and their populations are in recovery.

Georgia has a mountainous interior consisting of stepped flats and windswept, barren peaks. It is a breeding ground for fur seals and king penguins, which can occasionally cause trouble near human settlements. The Candlemas islands are almost entirely uninhabited except for a weather and scientific station on Thule Island, and are prone to strong earthquakes. The climate there is characterised by long, cold winters and cool summers, with weather that changes quickly.

Georgia has a good port in its capital, and serves as a staging point for antarctic expeditions in {{<link/vekllei>}}. Seven towns, mostly based at former whaling stations, serve the Sudenese population, which are linked by trams. The population are hardy, descended from British and Norwegian whalers as well as settlers from the {{<link/falklands>}}. They have a close-knit, communal society dependent on fishing and government interest in the antarctic.
