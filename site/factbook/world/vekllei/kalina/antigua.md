The <span class="fi fi-antigua"></span> **Antiguan Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of {{<link/vekllei>}} in the Kalina archipelago, northeast of {{<link/allia>}} and south of {{<link/barbary>}}. It is roughly triangular, with an intricate coastline ringed by smaller islands and islets. Redonda, a small uninhabited island used historically for guano mining, lies between Allia and Oualie.

Antigua was originally inhabited by Arawaks, who were displaced by Caribs in the 12th Century. Antigua still has a large indigenous Carib minority population today. It was discovered by Europeans in the 15th Century and colonised by the British 200 years later. Antigua acted as a gateway for British interests in the Caribbean, and became a very successful sugar plantation with the labour of enslaved Caribs and Africans. Production there was disturbed by slave rebellions, but remained lucrative until the abolishment of slavery in the 19th Century, from which it declined for the next 100 years.

In place of sugar, Antigua has had to leverage its history as an entrepÃ´t and invested in its education sector. Antigua is the site of the original Commonwealth National University of the West Indies (CUWI) campus, founded in 1849. Today, education makes up most of the Antiguan economy, and is a primary destination for students relocating from smaller neighbouring islands like {{<link/allia>}} and Karu. It is also a major sponsor of foreign exchange and overseas study for the wider Caribbean, and hosts several prestigious international schools. It is home to the headquarters of the {{<link/cqc>}}.

Antigua is mostly flat, with hills in its southwest culminating in Independence Peak at 400m. Settlements and agriculture cover most of the flat land, the largest of which is the capital, Caribbea. Its prosperous colleges and universities are located there, and the settlements leading southeast are involved in tropical crops and textiles. Cosgrove, in Antigua's southwest coast, is the site of a major Universal Cotton factory.

Fast hydrofoils leave Caribbea's port daily, collecting students from neighbouring islands. V.C. Bird International is its major airport and has daily service to other parts of {{<link/kalina>}}. Two main rail lines run across and around the island respectively, and both Caribbea and Cosgrove have tram networks. Caribbea is also home to Naval Station Antigua, the second-largest naval service base and dockyard in Kalina.
