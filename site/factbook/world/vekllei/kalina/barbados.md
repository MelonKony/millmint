The <span class="fi fi-bb"></span> **Barbados Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Kalina archipelago, east of Youloumain and northeast of the [[Aloubaera]]. Although it is grouped with the rest of [[kalina|Commonwealth Kalina]], it is technically an Atlantic rather than Caribbean island, and is relatively flat for an island of its size. It is roughly triangular and densely populated, with most of its residents clustered around the capital of Indian Bridge on the southwest coast.

Uninhabited upon European discovery, Barbados has a long history as a gateway to the Lesser Antilles and South America. The island was settled by the British in the 17th Century and was reincorporated as part of the British Atlantic Territories in 1836. It gained independence along with the rest of the Territories a century later. Like the rest of [[kalina|Commonwealth Kalina]], the culture and demography of Barbados is heavily influenced by the legacy of slavery, and the majority of Barbadians are descended from Africans.

Sugar production dominated the Barbadian economy until the mid-20th Century, but the island was forced to diversify as prices and demand fell. It was supplemented by minor reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as fish and sugar derivatives like molasses. In the postwar [[Vekllei]] period, the export-heavy economy was corrected to better support its large and urban population through the development of hydroponic and agricultural cooperatives, and municipal manufacturing. Barbados is home to the largest robotics factory in Vekllei, which produces mostly industrial and construction automatons for [[National Machines]].

A patchwork of farms, mostly privately owned, quilt the wide tracts of arable land outside the capital. Barbados is the most densely-populated island in the Eastern Caribbean, and consequently is well-served by sophisticated Vekllei transport infrastructure. A coastal and interior rail line serve medium-distance routes, and trams and a metro are available in Indian Bridge. Travel to the island is primarily served by Sobers International Jetport and hydrofoils to neighbouring republics, and long-distance cruises also operate from the capital.
