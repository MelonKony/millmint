The <span class="fi fi-soualiga"></span> **Soualiga Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of [[Vekllei]] in the Caribbean. It is found just south of [[Anguilla]] and measures about 20km tall north to south. It is a lush volcanic island about 400m tall in the centre, which slopes away dramatically to reveal steep plains, long white beachfronts and sand banks. Most of the island speaks French at home, but at one time the island was split between France and the Netherlands. Rumour has it a Frenchman and a Dutchmen partitioned the island after a walking contest, and this division can be felt today in the colonial architecture that survives in its towns.

Strong French influences run up and down the republic's history, and can still be noticed in the style of their towns, the sound of their song and the renown of their cuisine. The southern half of the island provides mostly physical testimony to Dutch colonisation, and little evidence remains of Dutch language or culture since the partition treaty expired centuries ago. Most Soualigans are descended from French, British, Asians, Africans or Amerindians. Like many former colonial societies in Vekllei, they practice a strong fusion cultures and are richer for it. Soualigan cuisine is especially renowned and charms everyone who discovers it. Seafood is a specialty, especially conch and salted fish, though nothing beats lobster prepared in butter the French way.

Soualigans are scattered around the island, mostly on the slopes of Paradis Peak on in the major towns hemmed in by coastal lagoons. Taking the train around the island will take you past sandy beaches, rich green vegetation and rolling hills. The main feature is the old 17th-century Fort Rouge, a grand old building which recalls days of buccaneering. Ferries regularly depart from Marigot and Orleans to neighbouring islands, and make excellent day trips.

The largest private employer on the island is the [[orleans|Orleans Steelworks]], which was founded in 2020 to attract Commonwealth investment in the republic's technical education and rail network. The mill occupies most of the area around the town of Orleans, and has become a landmark of the island. Most others are employed in technical education or training, local government, or salt production. The culture is quite insular, and the island receives comparatively few visitors to its neighbours. There is an airport in Orleans and a good quality rail network (a gift from the Commonwealth for the steelworks) that circles the island. 

Marigot, the capital, is the most splendid city of the republic. It is rich with French Creole foods, singing, dancing and wine. The slopes around the historic urban centre are terraced by orchards. There you can find the local campus of the Commonwealth University of the West Indies and most of the local government. Orleans, an industrial city in the shadow of the steelworks, is home to the Soualiga Technical School. Huge desalination plants operate there for use in the steelmaking process.
