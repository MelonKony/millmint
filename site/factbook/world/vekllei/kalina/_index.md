The <span class="fi fi-kalina"></span> **Kalina Commonwealth** (*Vekllei Kalina*) is a [constituent commonwealth](/constituents/) of {{<link/vekllei>}}, comprising the entire Lesser Antilles island chain and a few adjacent islands. It contains 20 island [republics](/republics/) that are densely populated and culturally diverse, and contribute much to Vekllei's overall population and industry. It is the second most-populous region after the {{<link/volcanic>}}, and is the most ethnically and linguistically diverse, owing to its unique history.

Kalina's climate is tropical and warm, moderated by the sea. Most of its islands are exposed to strong Atlantic trade winds, and are threatened by hurricanes and volcanic activity. The Commonwealth's close geographic proximity to the Caribbean and Americas means it is a common point of migration into {{<link/vekllei>}}, and the diversity between republics also indicates the diversity of their industry and services, which vary dramatically between islands.
