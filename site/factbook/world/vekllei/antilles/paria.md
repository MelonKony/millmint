The <span class="fi fi-paria"></span> **Republic of Paria** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the western Caribbean Sea comprising many islands and archipelagoes that fringe the coast of Venezuala. It is situated east of [[Bonaire]]and continues east as scattered islands until the Witness Islands southwest of [[Cama]] and west of [[Kairi]].

Paria has a small population clustered in Bethlehem, the only city and capital of the republic. Life there is remarkably similar to other Vekllei towns in the region, and rarely do Parians spend any time in the 60-70 uninhabited islands and cays that can be found in clusters east and west of the Botutuo Archipelago. Many are low-lying, wooded and sandy, but there are also rocky monumental island chains in the east.

The scattered coral atolls and limestone islands that comprise Paria -- among Vekllei's most culturally isolated republics -- have always resisted conventional history. The Guaiqueri people, accomplished seafarers who once commanded these waters, treated the archipelago as seasonal waystations rather than permanent settlements, leaving behind conch shell middens. When Spanish explorers charted the surrounding waters in 1529, christening them "Los Roques" with characteristic bluntness, the islands proved too small for sugar, too remote for administration, and too beautiful for serious exploitation -- becoming instead a perfect refuge for pirates and pearl divers.

Pearl diving gave Paria its first real economy through the 17th and 18th centuries, though by 1780 most beds were worked by free divers who had simply declared themselves beyond colonial authority. The capital Bethlehem acquired its biblical name from Methodist missionary Josiah Whitmore, who arrived on Christmas Eve 1847 and proclaimed he had found "a new Bethlehem under tropical stars." This zeal carried on to the first Caribbean Federation in 1910, when the Pariense delegation insisted the new capital be chosen not for convenience but for beauty, declaring that "government should conduct itself where it cannot forget the grace of creation."

The capital, Bethlehem, is pretty but underdeveloped and has only a few large buildings by the harbour. Life and property is communal on the island, and is disturbed only by the [[Bethlehem Hospital]] and the interests of the Littoral Service in the region. Many Parians work at the hospital, which sees many people coming and going from all parts of Vekllei. East of the Botuto islands is a littoral service air station located on Orchilla, which polices Venezualan intrusions into Commonwealth waters and occasional smuggling. Few of Paria's islands are inhabited permanently, and they inspire many rumours of escaped madmen, pirates, criminals, shipwrecks and hermits that have renounced Commonwealth society.

Modern Paria has perfected what Vekllei federalists call "strategic municipalism," maintaining local customs that keep development manageable while fostering a society both timeless and contemporary. The republic's famous "Midnight Parliament" still meets under the stars on occasion, while Bethlehem's harbourfront cafÃ©s host debates between CUWI-trained marine biologists and fourth-generation fishing captains. Visitors find a people friendly but not eager, helpful but not dependent -- perhaps the Vekllei Caribbean's most successful example of cultural resistance wrapped in civilised hospitality.

A tramway exists in the capital, but otherwise the only way to get around is by boat. Fast ferries run between the Botutuo Archipelago and Scallop Island. The airstrip in the capital is popular among private seaplane pilots.
