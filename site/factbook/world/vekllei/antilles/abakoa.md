The <span class="fi fi-abakoa"></span> **Republic of Abakoa** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) in the southwest Caribbean Sea 190km east of the [[fra|Federal Republic of the Americas]] and south of the republic of Providence. It is a seahorse-shaped island taller than it is wide, measuring about 13km long. It is closely surrounded by a number of reefs and islets, most of which are uninhabited.

The island is home to the Raizal people, who have mixed indigenous, African, Spanish and English ancestry and speak an English creole. The island was only intermittently inhabited by indigenous people from Central America until Dutch discovery, and was permanently settled by the British in the 17th Century. These early settlements were easy targets for pirates, who raided the town of Sara repeatedly. Spain attempted to take the Abakoa in 1670 and succeeded in 1702, subsequently ruling it for the next 50 years. Much of Abakoan colonial architecture comes from this period, during which the island was rapidly fortified for its strategic position offshore of the Spanish colonies in Central and South America. The British retook them in the mid-18th Century and they remained British thereafter, until union with the Dominion of the West Indies and eventual Commonwealth accession.

The republic today retains its delightful frontier character, fusing indigenous influences from Central America with colonial Spanish and English towns and customs. The island is characterised by its white-sand beaches, lush palm groves, and vibrant coral reefs, which are part of the Seaflower Marine Reserve. The highest point on the island is Cerro La Loma, standing at 85 meters above sea level. Abakoa's coral reefs are among the richest in the Caribbean, home to hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and marine mammals.

Abakoans are friendly, communitarian and spiritual. Visiting any time of year will treat tourists to reggae, calypso and modern folk mixing freely in bars and cafes. Traditional dishes like rondón (a coconut-based seafood stew) and plantain-based treats are staples of Abakoan cuisine. The community is sharply divided into Anglicans and Catholics, typically reflecting their historic ancestry. The Catholics regularly hold colourful religious festivals involving dramatic recreations of biblical scenery. Despite the separation of churches, the differences are mostly unsubstantial and Abakoans mix between communities freely.

The capital of Sara is pleasant and colourful, and comprises a mix of Caribbean cottages uplifted by typical Vekllei features like canals and food gardens. Many trees have been planted in the streets of the capital and are in the process of growing and casting shade on sunny days. Murals and street art are found everywhere, as are trams linking the urban north to the villages in the south.

The economy is mostly municipal, and produces few goods for export. The republic produces an abundance of oranges, coconuts and copra. An annual pilgrimage around the coast of the republic, known as the Coast Walk or Coast Pilgrimage, attracts some visitors and inns have been set up to accomodate them. Most Abakoans are self employed or work for the public service. The [[LSRE]] Division of Marine Wildlife is headquarted in Sara.
