The <span class="fi fi-hetland"></span> **Hetland Republic** is a [constituent republic](/republics/) of {{<link/vekllei>}} in the North Atlantic Ocean. It comprises a group of about 100 islands east of the Vekllei republic of {{<link/aismious>}} between Norway and Scotland, though only a couple dozen of them are inhabited. They are skirted by rich undersea oil deposits which form the economic basis of the their economy, and its windswept and mostly treeless islands are famous for the quality of their wool.

Most Hetlanders live in Lerwick, the capital and largest city located on the island of Mainland. Historically, Hetland has been influenced by both Celtic and Norse cultures. First settled by the Norse in the 8th and 9th centuries, the islands were part of the Kingdom of Norway until they were transferred to the North Sea Kingdom in the 16th century. Throughout Norse settlement, an influx of Celtic settlers from Ireland and West Scotland influenced culture on the islands. This dual heritage is still visible today in the local dialect, place names, and traditions. One of the most famous cultural events is the Up Helly Aa festival, a Viking-inspired celebration featuring torch-lit processions and the burning of a galley, held annually in Lerwick.

Economically, the islands have traditionally depended on fishing, crofting (small-scale farming), and knitwear, particularly their famous Fair Isle sweaters. In recent decades, oil extraction from the North Sea has been exploited by {{<link/commoil>}}, bringing considerable development to the region. The Hetlands are also a popular tourist destination for Vekllei people because of their proximity to the British Isles, natural beauty, birdwatching opportunities, and rich archaeological sites. These include Jarlshof, which provide evidence for 4,000 years of human history on the islands.

Despite their isolation, the Hetlands are well-connected to both {{<link/aismious>}} and {{<link/oslola>}} by hydrofoil and air services. The islands maintain a strong sense of community and cultural identity, embracing both their Celtic and Norse legacies while adapting to modern challenges. Their recent prosperity and discovery of oil under the North Sea has brought it into economic conflict with the {{<link/uk>}}, and the {{<link/armed-forces>}} maintains Air Station Hetland on Mainland.
