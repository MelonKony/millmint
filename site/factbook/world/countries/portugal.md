The **Second Portuguese Republic** (commonly *Portugal*) was a Portuguese state that existed between 1926 and 2014. It succeeded the democratic First Republic and Portuguese Empire, and was ruled by the *Estado Novo* regime.

Portugal was incorporated into Iberia following the Spanish invasion of Portugal at the turn of the 21st Century. Portugal's defeat and subsequent annexation ended its independence and brought an end to the Portuguese Colonial War, which in turn decolonised most of its former empire.

In the late 20th Century, lusotropicalist foreign policy heightened tensions with the Republican government in Spain. These compounded historical grievances, including the Estado Novo regime's support of the francoist coalition during the Spanish Civil War, and the deportation of Spanish students in 1975.

Two different massacres in Portuguese colonies, the maintenance of which was strongly opposed by Madrid, led to sanctions on Portugal and military aid to anti-colonial rebels in its colonies. The war, which started in 2013, was provoked by the assassination of Spanish president Javier Marx, for which Portgual denied responsibility. The decision to annex European Portugal rather than depose the Estado Novo regime prompted strong criticism from the {{<link/un>}} and NATO.

Several former Portuguese territories are part of {{<link/vekllei>}} today. These include:
