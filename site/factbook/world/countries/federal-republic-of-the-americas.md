The **<span class="fi fi-fra-4x3"></span> Federal Republic of the Americas** (F.R.A.) is a country in central America, forming a contiguous stretch of territory between Mexico and Colombia, interrupted by the United States Panama Canal Zone. It comprises a number of historic colonial territories, including the Captaincy of Guatemala and the Viceroyalty of Panama. It has strong Spanish and indigenous heritage, and includes among its citizens hundreds of unique fusion cultures and indigenous communities.

The FRA is a parliamentary democracy, and has a strong republican tradition. Although it has much in common with the colonial histories of South America, disputes over trade areas and migrants have soured relations with Colombia and Venezuala. The FRA trades closely with Mexico, the U.S., Peru and [[Vekllei]]. It contests ownership over the Panama Canal with the United States.

As a federal country, the FRA is made up of nine states with regional parliaments and capitals. The federal capital is Santa Maria, a planned city on the isthmus west of Lake Nicaragua.
