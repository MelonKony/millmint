The **<span class="fi fi-dk"></span> Kingdom of Denmark** is a country in Western Europe, consisting of the Jutland peninsula extending north of central West Germany and an archipelago of over 400 islands west of it. The majority of its land and people are in Jutland, though its capital, Copenhagen, is located on the westward island of Zealand.

Despite its small population and size, Denmark has contributed extensively to European and world history, and through its extensive network of trade, has contributed to world culture as well. The historic Kingdom of Denmark has included territories that are now part of [[Vekllei]], including the [[Aismious]] (Faroese) islands and parts of western [[Oslola]].

Denmark is an advanced country with a high standard of living and a robust welfare state. Its economy is dominated by small service and manufacturing businesses, and government revenues are sourced primarily from taxes.
