The **<span class="fi fi-mu"></span> Republic of Mauritius** is a country in the south Indian Ocean, west of Madagascar. It consists of scattered volcanic islands fringed by coral reefs, which are rich with arable soil used mostly to grow sugar cane, its largest export. Mauritius's capital, Port Louis, is modern and well connected by good roads and its busy port.

Mauritius has a comfortable subtropical climate, with a cool and a hot season. Its people are mostly descended from indentured labourers from India and Pakistan who were compelled their during French rule. English is the official language, but Creole is most commonly spoken.

Mauritius is a developed society with an advanced economy, known for its frequent festivals among its diverse population. It has close economic ties with nearby [[Seychelles]] and close political ties with [[Vekllei]], and is a member of the [[COMOC]].
