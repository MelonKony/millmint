**Naval Station Verde**, located on the Azores island of {{<link/costa-verde>}}, serves as a vital maritime hub of the {{<link/vekllei>}} {{<link/marine>}} in the {{<link/atlantic>}}. Established in the late 19th century under the rule of {{<link/portugal>}}, the station initially operated as a strategic coaling and resupply point for Portuguese naval vessels. Over the years, it expanded into a modern naval base, equipped with automatic facilities for ship maintenance, refuelling, and training. Today, it serves as the base of [*Volcanic*-class](/volcanic-class/) Fleet Carriers and [*Nike*-class](/nike-class/) Missile Cruisers of the Commonwealth Fleet.

Situated in Ponta Delgada’s natural harbor, the station plays a critical role in monitoring the shipping lanes between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. It also serves as a key base for maritime patrols of the Littoral Service, search-and-rescue missions, and anti-piracy operations. The Naval Station has hosted joint operations with the UN anti-piracy task force, reinforcing its strategic significance.

The station mostly employs locals and has integrated itself into the community through outreach programs and open days, contributing to Costa Verde's ongoing maritime legacy.
