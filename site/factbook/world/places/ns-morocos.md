**Naval Station Morocos**, located on the Verde island of Morocos, serves as a nuclear refuelling and supply station of the {{<link/vekllei>}} {{<link/marine>}} in the {{<link/verde>}}.
Established in 2054, the station was originally built to support the increased fuelling demands of Vekllei nuclear naval vessels in the eastern Atlantic. Its strategic position at the crossroads of Atlantic shipping routes also made it a vital position for monitoring regional trade and bolstering the federalisation of the Verde archipelago.

The station is equipped with docking, refuelling, and maintenance facilities. It supports regional naval patrols, anti-smuggling operations, and search-and-rescue missions in the expansive Atlantic waters. The station also serves as a training centre for the Verdean component of the maritime service, primarily for coastal defence and maritime surveillance.

The station serves as the home station of [*Palm*](/palm-class/)-class submarine-chasers, but they have been serviced at {{<link/ns-java>}} while the renovations of the automatic dry-dock at Morocos are underway.
