**Naval Station Mira**, located just outside of Fennel on the island of Mira, is a key {{<link/vekllei>}} naval facility of the {{<link/marine>}} in the Atlantic Ocean. Established in the early 20th century by {{<link/portugal>}}, then the administrator of the island, the station was initially a strategic outpost for defending Portugal’s colonies and safeguarding maritime routes between Europe, Africa, and South America.

Today, the station has evolved into a modern naval base, serving the [*Baker*](/baker-class/) and [*Swordfish*](/swordfish-class/)-class of air escort destroyers. It also serves as a staging facility for Vekllei naval operations, including anti-piracy patrols. Its facilities include automatic ship repair docks, nuclear refuelling stations, and advanced communication systems for monitoring Atlantic shipping lanes.

Naval Station Mira is a lynchpin of Vekllei maritime security in the east Atlantic, often hosting search-and-rescue missions and environmental monitoring in the surrounding waters. It also plays a significant role in the local economy, providing jobs and contributing to Fennel’s naval heritage.
