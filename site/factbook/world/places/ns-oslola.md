**Naval Station Oslola**, located on the fortified island of Kolumbo off the southern coast of {{<link/oslola>}}, is the largest and most advanced naval facility in the {{<link/vekllei>}}. The dockyards there date back hundreds of years, and the site has served as a naval fort since at least the 15th Century. Today, it is a densely-developed island complex housing the Oslola Commonwealth Docks, a dozen automatic shipyards, the Commonwealth Naval School and powerful radar arrays. It is also home to a warren of forts and coastal fortifications, guarding the inhabited southwest coast of Oslola.

Although federalisation has decentralised much of Vekllei's naval industry, Naval Station Oslola remains the largest and most important of its naval facilities. It contains the King Dock, the only dry-dock capable of manufacturing and maintaining the *Veletia*-class supercarrier. It also houses the Commonwealth Submersible Plant, a collection of factories building [*Capricorn*](/capricorn-class/) and [*Mantle*](/mantle-class/)-class submarines. It is also the home station for most of the maritime service's oversized oceangoing vessels, including the *Federal*-class battleship and most of its battlecruisers.
