**Naval Station Santes**, located on the remote island of {{<link/santes>}} in the South Atlantic, is one of the most isolated naval installations in the world. It is an important maritime facility of the {{<link/vekllei>}} {{<link/marine>}}.

Established by the {{<link/uk>}} in the early 20th century, its original purpose was to serve as a monitoring outpost for maritime activity during World War I. Given Santes's strategic location along key shipping routes between South America and Africa, the station played a quiet but vital role in monitoring naval traffic and submarine movements during both World Wars.

Today, Naval Station Santes operates as a small yet advanced facility focused on oceanographic research, maritime surveillance, and environmental monitoring. It features a modern weather station and a deep-sea submersible docking area, unique due to its proximity to the South Atlantic’s unexplored depths. The station is also instrumental in supporting scientific expeditions to the island and surrounding waters, making it a hub for both naval and environmental activities of the {{<link/LSRE>}}.

No class of Vekllei ships call at Santes as a home station, but facilities for docking and replenishing *Capricorn*-class attack submarines are located at the station.
