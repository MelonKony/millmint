<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Helvasia**, located in the remote Arctic archipelago of [[Helvasia]], serves as the northernmost naval installation in [[Vekllei]] and headquarters for Arctic maritime operations. Originally established as a Norwegian coaling station in the early 20th century, the facility was expanded during World War II to serve as a weather monitoring outpost and potential staging base for Arctic convoys. The harsh Arctic environment and strategic location have made it a vital component of Vekllei's northern maritime defence strategy.

The modern facility operates as a fortress of the [[Maritime Service]] and a critical hub for Arctic Fleet operations. The station maintains specialised cold-weather capabilities including ice-strengthened berthing facilities, Arctic survival training centres, and advanced weather monitoring systems. Its position provides crucial oversight of Arctic shipping lanes and serves as a deterrent to Soviet territorial ambitions in the region. The facility also supports scientific expeditions and environmental monitoring in the High Arctic.
