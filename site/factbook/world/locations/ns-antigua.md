**Naval Station Antigua**, situated in the natural harbour of English Harbour on the southern coast of [[Antigua]], is a major maritime facility of the [[marine|Marine Services]] of [[Vekllei]]. The complex has a long maritime history dating back to the 18th century. Originally established as a Royal Navy base of the [[UK]], it was a crucial outpost in the Caribbean, serving as a repair dockyard and strategic fort during the height of British colonial power. The station's sheltered position protected naval fleets from hurricanes and served as a defensive stronghold against piracy and European rivals. Much of the original fortifications survive, and are still in use in some capacity in the current station.

Today, Naval Station Antigua is a modern naval base, featuring expanded dry-docks and a radar station. Its unique facilities include a heritage shipyard, which preserves parts of the original 18th-century dockyard, and a civil defence station that specialises in coastal search-and-rescue and disaster response training for the Littoral Service. The facility is also an important base of operations for international anti-drug trafficking operations, and maintains strong ties with neighbouring Caribbean nations. It is the home base of the [[kalina|Commonwealth Kalina]] Auxiliary Fleet.
