<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Morocos**, located on the Verde island of [[Morocos]], serves as a nuclear refuelling and supply station of the [[Vekllei]] [[marine|Marine Services]] in the [[verde|Commonwealth Verde]]. Established in 2054 to support the increased operational tempo of Vekllei nuclear naval vessels in the eastern Atlantic, the station occupies a strategic position at the crossroads of Atlantic shipping routes. The facility played a crucial role in the federalisation process of the Verde archipelago, providing both maritime security and economic integration for the region.

The station specialises in nuclear vessel support operations, featuring advanced docking, refuelling, and maintenance facilities specifically designed for nuclear-powered warships. Beyond its technical capabilities, the installation serves as a regional training centre for the Verdean component of the maritime service, focusing on coastal defence and maritime surveillance operations. The facility also coordinates regional naval patrols, anti-smuggling operations, and search-and-rescue missions across the expansive eastern Atlantic waters. While [*Palm*](/palm-class/)-class submarine-chasers are designated as the station's home vessels, ongoing renovations to the automatic dry-dock have temporarily relocated their servicing to [[ns-java|Naval Station Java]].
