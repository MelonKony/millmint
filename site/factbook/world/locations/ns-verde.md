<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Verde**, located on the Azores island of [[Costa Verde]], serves as a vital maritime hub of the [[Vekllei]] [[marine|Marine Services]] in the [[atlantic|Commonwealth Atlantic]]. Established in the late 19th century under Portuguese rule as a strategic coaling and resupply point, the station has evolved into a modern naval facility equipped with automatic maintenance systems and advanced logistics capabilities. Its position at the crossroads of Atlantic shipping routes makes it indispensable for monitoring European, African and American maritime traffic.

The station currently serves as the primary base for [*Volcanic*-class](/volcanic-class/) Fleet Carriers and [*Nike*-class](/nike-class/) Missile Cruisers of the Commonwealth Fleet. Its comprehensive facilities include nuclear refuelling stations, heavy-lift dry-docks, and sophisticated radar arrays capable of tracking surface vessels across hundreds of nautical miles. The facility plays a crucial role in anti-piracy operations and coordinates closely with UN maritime security task forces.
