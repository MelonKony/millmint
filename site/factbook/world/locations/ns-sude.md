**Naval Station Sude**, located in Godthul in the [[Sude]] Islands, is a peripheral [[marine|Marine Services]] naval station of [[Vekllei]]. Originally established as a whaling station in the early 20th century, Godthul became one of the world’s largest whaling hubs, operating until the mid-1960s when commercial whaling declined. During World War II, the station was briefly fortified by British forces to guard against potential Axis activity in the Southern Ocean.

Naval Station Sude was formally established following the 2015 Antarctic Crisis, and plays a significant role in maintaining [[Vekllei]] sovereignty over the South Hetland islands. It currently supports a small naval garrison, along with a detachment of Littoral Service vessels. The Naval Station also supports general government and civilian shipping as a staging base for Antarctic and South Atlantic expeditions.
