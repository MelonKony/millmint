<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Sedna** is a [[armed forces|Naval]] station of the [[Vekllei]] [[Maritime Service]], located in the republic of [[Kala]]. Originally established during the medieval period as part of the Oslolan North Sea Empire's expansion into Kalanese territories, the facility served as a forward naval base for controlling the Denmark Strait and monitoring North Atlantic approaches. The station's strategic position has made it a crucial element of northern maritime defence for centuries, with continuous development reflecting its enduring importance in Arctic naval operations.

The modern installation serves as the primary base for Arctic Fleet nuclear icebreaker cruisers, representing one of the most specialised naval facilities in the Vekllei maritime system. The station's unique capabilities include ice-strengthened berthing facilities, Arctic logistics support, and a range of specialised equipment for icebreaker operations.
