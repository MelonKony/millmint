The <span class="fi fi-police fis"></span> **Commonwealth Police College** is the central training institution for all [[Police|Commonwealth Police]] officers, located in Comet, the federal capital of [[Vekllei]]. Established in 2018, it serves as the sole institution responsible for standardised constable training across all [[republics]] of Vekllei.

The main campus occupies 180 hectares in the Meteor Valley, with additional training facilities scattered across the Commonwealth for specialised instruction. Architecture reflects Commonwealth institutional design with practical training facilities, residential halls for cadets, and specialised buildings for different endorsement programmes. The college employs about 320 instructional staff to train approximately 2,800 cadets annually across its various programmes.

Each cadet spends at least one month at their designated republic annex as part of their foundation training.

**Training Structure**:

The **Foundation Course** is a comprehensive 6-month programme that all cadets must complete, covering Commonwealth law, civic principles, basic investigation techniques, cultural competency, physical training, swordfighting and baton use, and firearms proficiency. Successful completion grants the base Constable commission.

**Primary Endorsement** programmes are intensive 3-month courses in chosen specialisations like Detective, Marine Policing, Treasury Policing, or Parliamentary Guard. These provide deep expertise in specific areas of law enforcement.

**Secondary Endorsements** are offered as 2-week intensive courses that allow constables to gain additional capabilities throughout their careers. Popular secondary endorsements include Commons Mediation, Cultural Heritage and various regional specialisations.

Continuing Education programmes ensure all serving constables maintain current skills and can pursue additional endorsements. Annual refresher training is mandatory, with new endorsement opportunities offered regularly.

Student life centres around practical training exercises that simulate real-world scenarios across different island environments. Through detachments are military training sites, the college maintains training facilities that replicate urban Oslolan conditions, remote Arctic environments, tropical Caribbean settings and maritime operations. The annual Inter-Circuit Exercise brings together cadets from all regional programmes for complex, multi-jurisdictional training scenarios. Police are also trained as a military reserve to mobilise Vekllei citizen-soldiers during wartime.

The college has exchange relationships with police training institutions in other nonaligned countries, particularly [[India]] and the [[Balkan Federation]], reflecting Vekllei's international police cooperation commitments. Many instructors are veteran constables who rotate through teaching assignments as part of their professional development, which helps ensure training remains current with field experience.
