<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Santes**, located on the remote island of [[Santes]] in the South Atlantic, represents one of the most isolated naval installations in the world. Established by the British in the early 20th century as a maritime monitoring outpost during World War I, the facility's strategic location along key shipping routes between South America and Africa made it a vital intelligence gathering point during both World Wars. The station's remote position and harsh environmental conditions have shaped its evolution into a highly specialised facility focused on deep-ocean operations.

Today, Naval Station Santes operates as an advanced facility specialising in oceanographic research, maritime surveillance, and environmental monitoring for the [[LSRE]]. The station features a unique deep-sea submersible docking complex, taking advantage of its proximity to some of the South Atlantic's most unexplored depths. While no major naval vessels call Santes home port, the facility maintains comprehensive support infrastructure for [*Capricorn*-class](/capricorn-class/) attack submarines, including specialised nuclear refuelling and maintenance capabilities that serve vessels operating in the southern Atlantic patrol areas.
