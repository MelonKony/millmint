The **National Levantine Theological University**, called the *NLTU* or *The College of the Mount* is the largest theological research university in [[Vekllei]], located in the republic of [[Sal]]. It is a multi-faith institution specialising in early Abrahamic faiths and levantine theology, and a number of specialist schools.

The campus of the NLTU is located on and around Monte Curral, and at its peak is its central gardens and reading area. The school buildings step down from the peak in a radial fashion, and are generally divided by religion. Although it has a keen theological focus, the NLTU is a secular institution and is administered by a council from all schools.

The university is extremely prestigious, and is also a unique institution in its focus and structure. Admission is competitive, and students live at the university for the duration of their studies. The NLTU hosts about 6,000 students each year, which accompany about 3,000 academics who teach and research year-round. Nearby towns, including the capital of Santa Maria, also provide boarding and dining facilities to students.

The school is famous for its tranquil grounds and peaceful quality, despite the proximity of so many different religious schools. There is zero tolerance for fighting, and the architecture of the school facilitates the constant flow of water and air throughout. Although much of the Sal republic is characterised by salt works and desert, the NLTU is famous for its lush gardens and modernist desert architecture adorned with mosaics and murals.
