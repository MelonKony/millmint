**Fortress Kabuli** is a fortress of the [[Vekllei]] [[Armed Forces]], located in the republic of Kabuli. It is among the larger Commonwealth military installations in the Caribbean, built into the steep slopes of Morne Bruce overlooking Roseau harbour. The fortress began as a modest British colonial fortification in the 1760s but was dramatically expanded during the postwar period into a sprawling complex of bunkers, barracks and weapons emplacements carved directly into the volcanic rock. Its position commands approaches from both sea and air, and the thick jungle canopy provides natural concealment from aerial observation. The fortress serves as the primary [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] base for the southern Kalina republics and houses the auxiliary regional command structure for the [[Territorial Service]] in the Caribbean.

The fortress is home to the 9th Sugar Guards Regiment, one of the Commonwealth's elite infantry formations with a distinguished history dating back to the Atomic War. The 25th Rifles Battalion, a rapid-response unit specialising in jungle warfare and disaster relief operations, maintains its headquarters within the fortress complex. The 20th Kalinan Rifles, recruited primarily from the Kalina Territory and other indigenous communities across the Caribbean republics, serves as both a combat unit and a cultural institution that preserves traditional martial practices. The regiment's distinctive ceremonial dress, incorporating Kalina patterns and symbols, has made them recognisable throughout Vekllei. During peacetime, these units conduct regular training exercises in Kabuli's mountainous interior and provide emergency response capabilities for the hurricane-prone Caribbean region.
