<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Java**, situated on the eastern coast of [[Java]] in the Gulf of Guinea, serves as a major maritime facility of the [[Vekllei]] [[marine|Marine Services]] and the primary naval presence in West African waters. Originally established by Portuguese colonial forces in the early 18th century to protect cocoa and coffee trade routes, the station served as a crucial refuelling and resupply point for colonial fleets navigating between Europe and southern Africa. Following Commonwealth accession, the facility underwent rapid expansion to support a substantial naval presence in the strategically vital Gulf of Guinea.

The modern installation functions as a comprehensive naval headquarters for regional operations, featuring advanced radar arrays capable of detecting surface vessels across hundreds of miles of ocean between Java and the African mainland. The station plays a central role in anti-piracy operations and strategic security patrols while supporting the construction and maintenance of multiple vessel classes. Naval Station Java houses the third-largest dry-dock facility in Vekllei, capable of accommodating [*Volcanic*](/volcanic-class/)-class aircraft carriers, and serves as home base for the [*Prosperity*](/prosperity-class/)-class aircraft cruisers and [*Hera*](/hera-class/)-class minelayer/minesweepers. The facility also hosts the East Atlantic Naval School, training personnel from across the [[atlantic|Commonwealth Atlantic]] and [[verde|Commonwealth Verde]].
