**Naval Station Kairi**, located on [[Kairi]]'s northern coast, serves as the primary maritime base for the [[kalina|Commonwealth Kalina]] and [[lucaya|Commonwealth Lucaya]] regions of the [[marine|Marine Services]]. It has its origins in the British colonial period, when the site was used in the early 17th century to protect valuable sugar trade routes. The fort there played a key role during the Napoleonic Wars, acting as a supply and defence point in the strategic Caribbean waters. Over time, it became a critical hub for British and later U.S. naval operations during World War II, where it was instrumental in securing the Atlantic from enemy submarines.

Today, Naval Station Kairi is a sprawling facility, home to several advanced shipyards, extensive dry-docks, and a state-of-the-art command centre for overseeing regional security. The station includes a tropical warfare training centre, used by different [[territorial|Territorial Services]] for joint exercises. Its dockyards are the home station of the [*Suffrage*](/suffrage-class/)-class corvettes, many of which were manufactured in the automatic docks at the site.
