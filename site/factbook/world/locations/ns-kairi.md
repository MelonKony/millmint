<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Kairi**, located on [[Kairi]]'s northern coast, serves as the primary maritime base and fleet headquarters for the [[marine|Marine Services]] Commonwealth Fleet. The site has operated as a naval facility since the early 17th century, when British colonial forces established fortifications to protect valuable sugar trade routes. The installation played a crucial role during the Napoleonic Wars and later served as a critical hub during World War II, where it was instrumental in Atlantic convoy protection operations.

Today, Naval Station Kairi operates as the largest and most advanced naval facility in the Caribbean, housing the Commonwealth Fleet's primary striking force including the supercarrier *CVN Veletia*. The sprawling complex features multiple automatic shipyards, extensive dry-dock facilities capable of servicing the largest Vekllei vessels, and a fleet command centre. The station's dockyards serve as the primary construction and maintenance facility for the [*Suffrage*](/suffrage-class/)-class corvettes, with many manufactured in the automated assembly facilities on-site.
