The <span class="fi fi-cuwi fis"></span> **Commonwealth University of the West Indies (CUWI)** is the federated higher education system serving [[Vekllei]]'s Caribbean [[republics]]. Modelled after ancient collegiate systems and adapted to the archipelagos of [[Kalina]] and [[Lucaya]], it comprises 32 constituent universities that maintain varying degrees of autonomy. 220,000 students are enrolled in CUWI, which is headquartered in the [[antigua|Antiguan]] capital of Caribbea. It is representative of the "nesting doll" nature of Vekllei higher education, since many of its constituent universities are themselves federated universities of different colleges and schools. As such, it is common to be enrolled as a student of a residential college, constituent university and CUWI simultaneously.

The university traces its origins to Codrington College, established in 1849 by the British Atlantic Company as a training school for colonial administrators and clergy. Its early curriculum focused on classical education and Anglican theology, housed in a single Georgian building that still stands in Caribbea. It has transformed substantially since then, and is second in students only to Commonwealth University, its historic rival. Like all Vekllei educational institutions, its standards and curriculum are maintained by the [[cqc|Curriculum & Qualifications Council]].

CUWI operates through three administrative tiers:  

{{<note>}}
**1. The Central University**

The Central University, which is itself an education institution in [[Antigua]], oversees pancollegiate standards and maintains the Examinations Board. It houses the administration of the federal system, including the Office of the Chancellor.

Several federal bodies oversee the CUWI network:

* The **University Congress** -- Annual meeting of all chancellors at Codrington Hall in [[Antigua]]  
* The **Sand Committee** -- Student representatives who mediate inter-campus disputes and work to build pancollegiate events and identity
* The **Academic Council** -- Mostly retired professors who advise on academic traditions

Despite its federalism, CUWI has consistent educational standards and graduates of different schools are expected to receive the same quality of training. The style and content of this training is left to individual schools, which retain their distinctive characters.

**2. Constituent Schools**

Constituent schools, which encompasses universities, research centres and institutes are autonomous tertiary institutions that usually deliver an academic discipline through courses or triposes. Constituent schools may be large, general universities with many faculties and campuses or smaller, specialised institutions.

Major constituents include [[university of karu|Karu University]], Commonwealth Medical University and Antigua University. Each of these are collegiate schools, meaning students are enrolled in autonomous colleges that control their own admissions and teaching.

**3. Colleges**

Some Constituent Schools are themselves federated into colleges, which are often older than the universities that comprise them. Colleges may be day schools or residential, and are independent of but subordinated to a university. Colleges control their own admissions, employ their own academic staff, provide their own tutorials and supervision and maintain their own buildings and governance. Residential colleges, where students board, manage their own accomodation and dining as well. They may enrol undergraduates and have several hundred students, or have only a few dozen postgraduates focused on research.

While students enrolled in colleges primarily interact with the university through them, colleges themselves do not award degrees. Students graduate with university degrees bearing the CUWI seal and are not awarded degrees from their colleges.

Although CUWI maintains a number of major constituent general universities, many of its federated schools are specialised institutions that share resources and facilities with neighbouring campuses. In a quirk of Vekllei federalism, they can indicate local specialisation (e.g. Inagua's salt industry of Kairi's oil industry) or no local custom at all, when the distant eye of Commonwealth federalism deems a republic the new centre of an academic tradition. Most constituents have a research focus and 80% retain a field station for local ecosystem studies. A student of one is a student of all, and transfer and exchange are common practices within the network.

Through its academic divisions and constituent schools, CUWI offers comprehensive programs across all disciplines, with particular strengths in tropical medicine, maritime engineering, Caribbean studies, performing arts and advanced agriculture. Degrees are awarded by constituent schools but bear the CUWI seal. 

Depending on the constituent school, students may enrol in an academic department (i.e. School of English) or with a residential college (i.e. Trinity College of [[university of karu|Karu University]]) which affects their course structure and tutorials. Undergraduate programmes allow transfers between constituent schools after the first year. Faculty also move freely between schools. CUWI schools also share a digital library system containing over 2.7 million volumes and have access to the Federal Library network.

The academic culture at CUWI is most obviously influenced by British tutorial traditions (including weekly supervision meetings) but has evolved substantially in the federal period with contemporary [[education|Atlantic Model]] learning. A distinguishing characteristic from other Commonwealth universities are its Caribbean pedagogical styles including a preference for spoken examinations.

Life at CUWI involves a number of events and festivals, including an annual cricket tournament dating to 1903 called the Chancellor's Cup. This has evolved into a pancollegiate festival involving a number of competitions, including in robotics and sailing. The Creole Debating Society is among the fiercest in Vekllei, but attends most debates overseas in Creole and French-speaking parts of the world.

About 30% of students complete at least one semester at another constituent university. Campuses share traditions including a symposium where graduate students present papers aboard ferries sailing between islands known as Carnival. Like most Vekllei universities, CUWI schools often have strong maritime traditions, and classes can even be held at sea. New students receive a bottle containing sand from their home island as a longstanding matriculation ritual.
