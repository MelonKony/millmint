<span class="fi fi-maritime-service fis"></span> **Naval Station Mira**, located just outside Fennel on the island of [[Mira]], serves as a key [[Vekllei]] naval facility of the [[marine|Marine Services]] in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Established in the early 20th century by [[Portugal]] as a strategic outpost for defending Portuguese colonies and safeguarding maritime routes between Europe, Africa, and South America, the station has evolved into a comprehensive modern naval base serving advanced destroyer forces.

The facility operates as the primary base for [*Baker*](/baker-class/) and [*Swordfish*](/swordfish-class/)-class air escort destroyers, providing crucial air defence capabilities for Atlantic shipping lanes. Its comprehensive facilities include automatic ship repair docks, nuclear refuelling stations, and advanced communication systems for monitoring eastern Atlantic maritime traffic. The station serves as a cornerstone of Vekllei maritime security operations, frequently coordinating search-and-rescue missions and environmental monitoring throughout the surrounding waters. The facility maintains strong integration with local Fennel community and contributes significantly to the island's naval heritage and economy.
