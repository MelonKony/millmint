**Naval Station Summers**, located at Irish Head in [[Summers]], is a major [[marine|Marine Services]] naval station of [[Vekllei]]. It comprises an automatic dockyards and berthing facilities for the largest Vekllei naval ships, including [[Federal-class]] battleships. A number of associated facilities are headquartered there, including the Naval Infantry Training School and the American Radar Array.

The station has a long history dating back to British fortification of the island in the 18th Century. It served as a naval fortress for the Royal Navy, and has expanded in that role since Commonwealth accession. A naval fort in Great Sound known as Bloody Head has received substantial upgrades in the 2040s, including the installation of long-range anti-ship missiles.
