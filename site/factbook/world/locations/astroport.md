The Vekllei World Astroport is the largest spaceport of [[Vekllei]] and the primary link to the Vekllei Lunar Territories. It is a combined civilian, military and research spaceport located on [[Ascension]] that launches around eight flights a day to the moon via [SSTOs](/stories/lightbulb/).

The spaceport is serviced by both a [[air|Commonwealth Airways]] shuttle and [[starlines|Commonwealth Starlines]], which provides services into space and towards the moon.

The cosmodrome has two terminals, one for civilian and one for government use. Two flights leave for the moon per day, CF 1 and 2.
