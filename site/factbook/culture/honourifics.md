Although most modern [[Vekllei]] English is informal in tone, its social language remains rich in titles and forms of address. This is an endearing quirk of a country which otherwise is communal and egalitarian by Western standards. In general, titles are written with a period (e.g., *Mrs.* and *Ms.*), following the American style in a break from their British literary tradition.

Since multiple titles may apply, they are generally respected in the following order, with subsequent forms of address replaced by more respected forms.

| **Honourific** | **Example** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Professional Address** | *Capt., Dr., P.M.* | Professional titles are generally life-long and are granted by professional accreditations or offices. |
| **Occupational Address** | *Con., Dir., Dr.* | Occupational titles generally replace personal address, even among regular acquaintances. |
| **Personal Address** | Mr., Mrs., Ms. | Subordinated to occupational titles. |
| **General Address** | Sir, Madam | Default polite address; gendered but neutral in tone. The apparent occupation of a person often substitutes these general forms. |

In Vekllei, *sir/madam* forms the basis of general address for strangers.[^madam] Vekllei is a heavily uniformed culture and it is common to intuit the occupation of a stranger, in which case you would address them by the occupation (i.e. Policeman, Butcher).

**Please note**: Vekllei does not gender occupational titles. *Policeman* refers to both male and female constables, as does equivalents like *chairman* and *postman*.

The written style of general forms of address include:

| **Form** | **Usage** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Sir** / **Madam** | Used when addressing strangers, service staff, or correspondence with unknown recipients. 'Madam' is rarely abbreviated as 'ma'am.' | Default polite address; gendered but neutral in tone. |
| **Mr.** | Used for men and boys within the community. | Denotes familiarity without intimacy. |
| **Mrs.** | Used for married women within the community. | The most traditional and still common form. |
| **Miss.** | Used for unmarried women or younger women. | Sometimes replaced by *Ms.* for neutrality. |
| **Ms.** | Used for women regardless of marital status. | Perfectly acceptable and widely used in Vekllei. |
| **Dr.**, **Prof.**, **Capt.**, etc. | Used for professional and occupational address. | Professional titles are used extensively and often preferred to gendered forms. |

In Vekllei communities, people refer to anyone they know -- other than close friends -- by a title and surname. Children are taught early to address adults as *Mr.* or *Ms.* followed by their family name, even outside formal settings.

Professional occupations also have their own forms of address:

| **Form** | **Usage** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Con.** | *Constable*, used for professionals with a [[police]] commission. | Occupationl address overrules nonspecific gendered forms but is subordinated to professional address. |
| **Dir.** | *Director*, typically used for company heads and senior civil servants in Vekllei. | Occupationl address overrules nonspecific gendered forms but is subordinated to professional address. |
| **Fr.**, **Sr.**, etc. | *Father/Sister*, used in religious contexts. | Retains traditional use, especially in [[Kalina]], [[Atlantic]] and [[Verde]]. |

[^madam]: In Vekllei, *madam* is not usually shortened to *ma'am*.
