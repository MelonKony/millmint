## Overview

**Upen** is the animistic, nondenominational dominant and historical religion of Vekllei. Practiced commonly throughout the Home Islands and Vekllei's possessions, it is a core component of Vekllei culture and heritage, and has existed in various forms for thousands of years. Because *Upen* is fundamentally provincial and decentralised, its scripture and practice vary significantly between boroughs. Most forms emphasise object animism, impermanence, petite materialism, land dependence, existentialism and fear of nature.

Upen can be practiced at natural shrines, usually designated by a cairn, at running or still water, or the seaside. Maritime living and seafood are important aspects of Vekllei life, and fishing and ocean myths are key elements in *Upen*. Within its spiritualism, traditional folk-tales and scripture are called *sagas*, which have also archived much of Vekllei's early history.

Although traditionally atheist, *Upen* is commonly adopted by immigrant populations that include Catholic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths. In these contexts, *Upen*'s animism and dependence on landscape is held alongside traditional beliefs, which are so common postwar that both Jewish and Catholic metaphysics have appeared in mainstream *Upen* doctrine in some cities, where large immigrant populations reside.

### Introduction


You can find *Upen* all around you in Vekllei since, by its own spiritual metaphysics, animism is not human. It exists independently of human understanding or spirit, and *Upen* is merely the practice by which humans are cognisant and interact with the spirit of things. Wherever people and material existence collide, including man-made objects, you find *Upen*.

In this sense, *Upen* can be understood as having two distinct forms, practiced differently depending on the occasion:

* Public *Upen*, which involves priests, communities, ceremony and cultural artefacts (like [*Upotenne*](/factbook/society/culture/language/#25--upotenne) and [*Rapotenne*](/factbook/society/culture/language/#23--rapotenne)). Public *Upen* manifests similarly to other faiths, in which sites of worship, historical texts and sacred spaces inform practice and understanding.
* Private *Upen*, which involves personal understanding and direct physicality with the aspects of material being *Upen* holds sacred, namely the spirit of all things and the human form.

Although *Upen* does retain priests informally, it lacks a hierarchical structure and is largely agnostic towards organised religion, lived and practiced instead through traditions, folklore, lifestyle and metaphysics.

As atheistic and animistic, *Upen* shelters landscape from becoming â€˜simply natureâ€™, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. Within Vekllei's 'landscape' agnosticism, nature is not â€˜simply natureâ€™; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.

## Etymology

Upen as a word has its origins lost to time, but its linguistic characteristics can be found throughout modern Vekllei language. *U* (pronounced 'oo') is a prefix applied to matters of consciousness considered sacred or special, as replicated in the spirit-language of [*Upotenne*](/factbook/society/culture/language/#6-upotenne). *Upen* likely has origins in a proto-*Islandi* language called *Kala*, which later was absorbed into *Topyas*, the predecessor to [Vekllei](/factbook/society/culture/language).

In modern usage, *Upen* refers to both the faith and metaphysic of Vekllei's local animism, as well as a general indicator for Vekllei faith, myth and traditional folklore.
