The **Volcanic-class fleet carrier** is a class of aircraft carrier of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. Their introduction over the middle of the 21st Century represents a significant advancement in {{<link/vekllei>}} naval aviation capabilities, designed to project air power over Commonwealth [republics](/republics/) and support various strategic roles. With a displacement of 60,000 tons, the vessel accommodates a large air wing (or "section") typically comprising 40 to 50 aircraft, including VTOL advanced strike fighters.

Constructed with a flat-deck design and equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system, the *Volcanic*-class allows for rapid launching of aircraft. The carrier’s nuclear propulsion system enables extended deployments without the need for frequent refuelling, allowing the class to patrol Vekllei's territories almost continuously.

Armament features include the No. 3 *Rackham* air-to-air missile system, as well as a close-in weapon system (CIWS) for point defence, as part of a multilayered threat defence against aerial and missile attacks. The vessel also carries the No. 5 *Spearhead* anti-ship missile.

The *Volcanic*-class serves multiple roles, including fleet air defence, strike operations, and amphibious support. Its versatility allows for the coordination of joint operations with other naval and air assets, and forms the cornerstone of Vekllei's regional fleets. The capability of the *Volcanic* class to project power while maintaining logistical support for air operations underscores its importance in contemporary Vekllei naval doctrine.
