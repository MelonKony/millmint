The **Hera-class minelayer/minesweeper** is a class of anti-submarine patrol ship of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The class is a compact and highly manoeuvrable vessel designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations in both coastal and open waters. With a displacement of 1,500 tons and a length of 80 meters, it is smaller than traditional destroyers and designed specifically for detecting and engaging submarines.

Powered by the small variant of the [*NMPR*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear propulsion system, the Palm-class can reach speeds of up to 35 knots, allowing it to move quickly in response to submarine threats. Its crew of 85 operates the various ASW systems onboard, which are the primary focus of the class’s design.

The ship is equipped with the No. 12 *Triton* towed sonar array system, which provides long-range detection of submarines. For close-range engagements, it uses a bank of No. 3 *Seascope* anti-submarine torpedoes, launched from four fixed tubes. The *Palm*-class also features depth charge racks at the stern, allowing for more traditional anti-submarine attacks in shallow waters.

The ship’s self-defence armament is relatively minimal, with a single 30 mm auto-cannon and short-range No. 4 *Lucaya* anti-aircraft missiles to fend off aerial threats. It is also equipped with countermeasure systems, including decoys and noisemakers, to evade torpedo attacks.

The *Palm*-class operates primarily as part of larger ASW task groups in the Commonwealth Fleet, escorting convoys or patrolling known submarine hunting grounds. Its size and agility make it well-suited to engaging enemy submarines in confined areas or near strategic waterways.
