The **Nike-class Missile Cruiser** is a class of cruiser of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It was designed as a strategic offensive fleet component with multi-role capabilities, primarily focusing on fleet air defence and limited anti-submarine warfare. They were commissioned and constructed at Oslola Naval Docks beginning in 2025, and offer a robust platform for command and control operations across Vekllei's far-flung Atlantic territories. The home station of the class is {{<link/ns-verde>}}.

Powered by a nuclear steam propulsion system, the *Nike*-class can sustain prolonged deployments with minimal logistical support, though they almost always serve as a fleet component. Its maximum speed of 30 knots allows for rapid repositioning in response to emerging threats. The ship's displacement of 9,500 tons provides ample space for advanced weaponry and onboard facilities, and houses around 250 crew.

Armament includes the No. 3 *Rackham* missile system, capable of engaging both air and surface targets at ranges exceeding 100 kilometres from four twin-arm launchers at its fore and aft. In regular sailing it carries an armament of about 60 Type 22s. The cruiser is also outfitted with launch tubes for No. 5 *Spearhead* anti-ship missiles. A 76 mm dual-purpose gun serves as the primary close-in weapon system, complemented by two No. 3 *Seascope* torpedo launchers for anti-submarine operations.

The *Nike*-class was designed to support carriers within task groups, conducting patrols, deterrent operations, and strategic reconnaissance missions. Its capabilities make it an integral component of Vekllei naval strategy, aiming to maintain maritime security and project power across the Atlantic.
