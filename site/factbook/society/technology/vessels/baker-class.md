The **Baker-class air escort destroyer** is a class of aerial warfare destroyer of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. They were constructed at {{<link/ns-mira>}} in the late 2020s and throughout the 2030s to improve the air defence of Vekllei fleets. They serve with the Commonwealth, Arctic and Antarctic fleets to provide air defence and escort capabilities for naval task groups. With a displacement of 8,500 tons and a length of 160 meters, the ship is equipped to operate independently in contested maritime environments. Its production has been succeeded by the [*Swordfish*](/swordfish-class/) class.

Propelled by a [*Vampire*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear power plant, the Baker-class can maintain a speed of 35 knots, making it among the fastest large Vekllei warships. The crew complement of 320 personnel includes a mix of officers and enlisted sailors trained in various combat and support roles. The class is also equipped with a hanger capable of stowing two naval aviation helijets for anti-submarine and surface combat roles.

Armament includes the No. 3 *Rackham* air defence system, utilising its powerful radar dome and to intercept aerial threats at medium ranges. A refit in the 2050s also equipped the class with upgraded dual-launchers for newer No. 6 *Shemozzle* anti-ship missiles, enhancing its ability to engage large surface targets. For close-range defence, the Baker-class is equipped with a 76 mm gun and a CIWS system to counter incoming missiles and aircraft.

In addition to its combat capabilities, the Baker-class performs roles such as surveillance and reconnaissance, operating alongside aircraft carriers (like the *[Volcanic](/volcanic-class)*-class) and other surface ships to protect naval formations.
