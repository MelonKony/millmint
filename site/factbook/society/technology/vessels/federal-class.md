The **Federal-class battleship** is a class of battleship of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The class is a modern take on the traditional battleship, repurposed for fire support roles in amphibious operations and naval engagements. With a displacement of 45,000 tons and a length of 260 meters, it is one of the largest non-carrier surface combatants in the world, designed to deliver sustained heavy firepower in support of ground forces, as well as against naval and coastal targets.

The battleship is powered by two [NMPR](/nmpr/) reactors, enabling a top speed of 26 knots. The ship is designed for long-range operations with minimal logistical support, and employs autonomous systems with onboard replenishment capabilities. A crew of 1,100 operates the Federal-class, with most personnel working in fire control and aircraft operations.

The *Federal*-class is heavily armed with six 406 mm (16-inch) naval guns, housed in two triple turrets. These guns are capable of providing long-range bombardment of shore targets and enemy vessels. It has several other smaller guns for close-in and flak defence. The ship also features two large twin-arm launch-rail systems capable of fielding No. 2 *Lancet* cruise missiles, among a variety of other large anti-ship missiles and rocket-launched torpedos. For defence, the class is equipped with a mix of short-range anti-air missiles and CIWS to counter incoming missile threats. The *Federal*-class also includes a range of medium and long-range torpedoes, fired from launchers in its midship.

The *Federal*-class retains a complement of helijets -- a hybrid aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, combining the roles of helicopters and jet fighters. The ship’s flight deck, located aft, can accommodate up to six helijets that are typically used for reconnaissance, air support, and anti-submarine warfare.

The *Federal*-class primarily serves in a fire support role, delivering heavy bombardment during amphibious operations or coastal sieges. It is also capable of engaging in surface combat, providing area defence for larger task groups. While its role in modern naval warfare is more specialised compared to earlier eras, the *Federal*-class is a formidable platform for sustained, high-volume firepower in maritime and littoral zones. Its size and armament also imposes a significant psychological effect, a reputation readily exploited by the {{<link/marine>}} during shore bombardment trials. The only vessel of its class, *CVN Commonwealth*, serves with the Commonwealth Fleet.
