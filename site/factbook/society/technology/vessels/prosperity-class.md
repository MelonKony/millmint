The **Prosperity-class Aircraft Cruiser** is a class of cruiser of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is a hybrid warship that combines the fire-support and missile defence role of a traditional cruiser with the ability to carry a small complement of VTOL aircraft. Designed primarily for independent operations or as part of smaller task forces, the class is capable of supporting limited air operations while also providing surface warfare capabilities. Its home station is {{<link/ns-java>}} in {{<link/java>}}.

Displacing 30,000 tons and measuring 240 meters in length, the Prosperity-class is powered by the [*Vampire*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear power plant, allowing it to operate at a sustained speed of 27 knots. The vessel carries a typical air wing of 12 to 16 aircraft, including VTOL multirole fighters and anti-submarine helijets. These aircraft are launched from a large flat deck at the aft of the ship, enabling up to 4 aircraft on deck at a time.

The primary armament includes the  No. 3 *Rackham* anti-aircraft missile system, designed for medium-range defence against air targets. The ship also has twin-launchers for No. 5 *Spearhead* anti-ship missiles, offering surface-to-surface engagement capabilities. Close-in defence is handled by multiple CIWS installations, protecting the ship against incoming missiles and aircraft. Additionally, the Prosperity-class is outfitted with dual 76 mm naval guns for surface action and shore bombardment as an naval invasion support vessel. Anti-submarine capabilities are provided by its air complement.

The Prosperity-class is versatile, and serves a variety of roles with the Vekllei navy. The class of ship is suited for operations where a full-sized carrier (like the [*Volcanic*](/volcanic-class/)-class) is not necessary but air support is still required, making it a valuable asset in contested regions and asymmetric operations common in Vekllei's strategic interest. Its combination of defence systems and air complement allow it to act as a deterrent and as a flexible mothership for a variety of naval missions.
