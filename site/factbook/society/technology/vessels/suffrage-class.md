The **Suffrage-class corvette** is a class of corvette of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The Suffrage-class is a smaller, versatile surface combatant designed for patrol, escort, and coastal defence roles. With a displacement of 2,500 tons and a length of 100 meters, the class is large for a corvette, and has an operational capability closer to a frigate than a coastal patrol vessel.

Powered by the [*Vampire*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear power plant, the corvette can reach speeds of up to 35 knots, making it fast and agile for its size. Its relatively small crew of 120 operates the ship’s various systems, including weapons, sensors, and communications equipment, and retains a suite of automatic targeting and detection systems to reduce crew workload.

The ship’s armament includes a “Vanguard” dual-purpose 76 mm naval gun for surface and air engagements. In addition, it is equipped with “Harpooner” anti-ship missiles for striking surface targets at medium range and a short-range anti-air missile system for self-defense against aerial threats. For anti-submarine operations, the Suffrage-class carries two lightweight torpedo launchers, making it capable of limited ASW missions.

The Suffrage-class is equipped with advanced radar and sonar systems, providing situational awareness in both open-ocean and coastal environments. Its relatively small size and versatility allow it to perform a range of missions, including escorting larger vessels, conducting patrols, and participating in maritime security operations.

While not as heavily armed or armored as larger warships, the Suffrage-class ocean corvette is a flexible asset suited for environments where larger ships may be less practical. Its role in fleet operations typically centers around providing defense, conducting reconnaissance, and engaging smaller surface threats.
