The **Capricorn-class Attack Submarine** is a class of submarine of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The class is a nuclear-powered vessel designed for a variety of underwater combat missions, including anti-ship, anti-submarine, and reconnaissance roles. With a submerged displacement of 7,500 tons and a length of 95 meters, the submarine is a key asset in Vekllei naval formations, capable of operating independently for extended periods without surfacing.

Powered by a variant of the [*NMPR*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear propulsion system, the Capricorn-class can achieve submerged speeds of up to 35 knots with its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jets. Its quiet propulsion system is designed for stealth, allowing it to remain undetected while conducting patrols or approaching enemy fleets. The submarine has a typical crew of 100, including officers and specialists trained for long-duration underwater missions.

The submarine’s armament includes six 533 mm torpedo tubes capable of launching the No. 8 *Orca* heavy torpedoes, designed for both anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. In addition to torpedoes, the Capricorn-class can launch No. 2 *Lancet* cruise missiles from these tubes, providing a secondary strike capability against land-based or large surface targets.

The vessel is also equipped with a sophisticated sonar suite, including passive and active sonar systems for detecting enemy submarines and ships at long ranges. Electronic warfare systems and decoys, among other countermeasures, form part of its defensive complement.

Unlike missile submarines, the *Capricorn*-class primarily serves larger naval formations in hunter-killer and carrier-defence roles. To these ends, they may stray hundreds of kilometres away from their fleets in search of threats.
