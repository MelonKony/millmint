The **Hera-class minelayer/minesweeper** is a class of minelayer of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The class was designed for both deploying and clearing naval mines, particularly in gulfs and channels of strategic interest to Vekllei. With a displacement of 4,000 tons and a length of 115 meters, the class was designed for operations in littoral and coastal waters, but is also capable of operating in deeper waters when necessary.

The ship is powered by a [*Vampire*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear power plant, allowing a maximum speed of 22 knots. The relatively small crew of 140 is complemented by a range of automated systems.

The Hera-class is equipped with a modular mine-laying system capable of deploying up to 150 naval mines of various types. This includes both defensive minefields to protect strategic locations and offensive minefields intended to deny access to enemy shipping routes. For mine-clearing operations, the ship is fitted with advanced sonar systems and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) designed to detect, neutralise, or recover naval mines.

In terms of armament, the ship carries a basic self-defence package, including a 30 mm auto-cannon and short-range No. 4 *Lucaya* anti-aircraft missiles to defend against aerial or surface threats. In Vekllei, the minelayers serve a support role alongside warships, and may be allocated to other fleets as required. Its dual-role design allows it to transition quickly between mine-laying and minesweeping missions.
