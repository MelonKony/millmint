The **Swordfish-class air escort destroyer** is a class of aerial warfare destroyer of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The Swordfish-class is a successor of the [*Baker*](/baker-class/)-class, incorporating updated technologies and design improvements. The class maintains its focus on air defence, providing escort for fleet carriers and other Vekllei naval formations. It is slightly larger than the *Baker* class, with a displacement of 9,000 tons and a length of 165 meters. Its home station is {{<link/ns-mira>}}.

The destroyer is powered by the same [*Vampire*](/nmpr/) marine nuclear power plant as its predecessor, but improvements to its hydrodynamics allows slightly faster sustained speeds of up to 33 knots. The crew size is slightly reduced to 310, due to increased automation in various ship systems.

The primary armament includes the same No. 3 *Rackham* air defence system, but larger radar arrays allows for longer-range and more precise targeting of aerial threats. The system is complemented by the No. 6 *Shemozzle* anti-ship missile launchers. A dual-purpose 76 mm gun, improved from earlier designs, and an upgraded CIWS provide point defence.

The *Swordfish*-class is also equipped with enhanced sensor and electronic warfare systems under two Automatic Asset Command computers, allowing it to detect and track potential threats at greater distances. These updates were made to counter American improvements to chaff detection in their anti-ship missiles. Like the *Baker*-class, the *Swordfish*-class is a core part of Vekllei fleet protection and patrol operations, and serves mostly with the Commonwealth Fleet.
