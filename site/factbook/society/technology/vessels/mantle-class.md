The **Mantle-class Ballistic Missile Submarine** is a class of submarine of the Maritime Service of the {{<link/marine>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. The class was designed to serve as a strategic deterrent, capable of launching nuclear-armed ballistic missiles from underwater and ensuring Vekllei's second-strike capability. With a submerged displacement of 18,000 tons and a length of 170 meters, the Mantle-class is the largest Vekllei submarine and is a cornerstone of its nuclear deterrent. Its home station is {{<link/ns-oslola>}}.

Powered by the same [*NMPR*](/nmpr/) hydromagnetic propulsion system as the smaller [*Capricorn*](/capricorn-class/)-class attack submarine, the *Mantle*-class can operate at submerged speeds of up to 30 knots. Its reactor allows it to remain submerged for extended periods, offering considerable operational flexibility and stealth in global patrol areas. A crew of 140 operates the submarine, including specialists in missile systems, nuclear operations, and submarine warfare.

The submarine’s primary armament consists of 10 vertical launch tubes capable of firing No. 2 *Oceanic* ballistic missiles, each of which can be fitted with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). These missiles give the *Mantle*-class significant strike range and capability.

In addition to its missile armament, the *Mantle*-class is equipped with No. 8 *Orca* heavy torpedoes in four tubes, enabling it to engage hostile submarines or surface ships if necessary. The vessel also carries advanced sonar and countermeasure systems to evade detection and attacks.

The Mantle-class SSBN is designed for long-duration patrols, operating undetected in the Atlantic (and elsewhere) while remaining a potent nuclear deterrent. Its role is primarily strategic, ensuring that retaliatory nuclear strikes remain possible in the event of an initial attack.
