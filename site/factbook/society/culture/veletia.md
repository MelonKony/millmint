**Veletia** is the national personification of [Vekllei](/vekllei/) and Commonwealth society. Historically she was most commonly depicted as a young Algic woman with a *canopia* spear, but today can take many forms. In contemporary appearances, she appears as one of the Six Sisters that reflect the six major ethnic and cultural groups of the Commonwealth. She appears commonly in artwork and films as a shorthand for the Commonwealth, and forms an important part of the Vekllei visual identity.

A male counterpart, called *Vincenci*, is occasionally used to represent Oslola. His appearance in political cartoons int eh 20th century coincided with the masculinisation of the 3rd Republic in Oslola, and has fallen out of general use in the postwar period.
