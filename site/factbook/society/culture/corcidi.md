**Corcidi Poetry** is a traditional form of poetry in Oslolan Algic culture. It is the practice of taking short poetic phrases and distilling their essential meaning into a single world. *Vekllei*, the name of the current Commonwealth of Oceans, is a Corcidi word meaning "people of the sea and stars."

The practice was first observed in Algic [sagas](/sagas/) from the 9th Century, though its origins may be rooted in early interactions with Scandinavian settlers.
