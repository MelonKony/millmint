Although [[Vekllei]] has a reputation of inscrutability, this can be misleading. While it does have unique features that prompt novel consideration of the structure and behaviour of its economy, it follows surprisingly orthodox economic logic and conventions, and its markets demonstrate a remarkable appetite for international trade and investment.

Looking at the metrics paint a surprisingly conventional picture that provides some clarity as to the basics of the economy. They have a wealthy, mixed market economy characterised by [[productivity|high productivity]], low corruption, and dirigisme. Since independence in 2017, the country has experienced high economic growth and has diversified considerably. The small and mechanical nature of their entrepôt cities means that their economy is highly advanced compared to the US and Europe, even if they are functionally poorer. They rank very well in major contributors to human development -- housing, education and health -- but lag in other important economic indicators, like consumption and purchasing power.

These outcomes are intuitive to those familiar with the history and geography of the country. Among its 78 constituent islands are among some of the world's great trading ports, and its massive exclusive economic sea zones control rich and exploitable resources. Situated between the US and Europe, as well as the growing factories of South America and Africa, the country facilitates international trade as a friendly and nonpartisan intermediary. Their economic pragmatism is consistent and reliable, and has established Vekllei as the "place countries meet."

## Structure

The most conspicuous aspect of the Vekllei economy is its functional moneylessness for most people. About 90 per cent of Vekllei [republics](/republics/) do not use money in their domestic markets; the remainder use an expiring money as they transition to the moneyless system.

This domestic market is called the *commons*, and accounts for about two thirds of the overall economy. The government rationale for intervention in the *commons* has weakened, and it mostly operates as a free (if unusual) market.

In addition to the expiring money, there is a second type of currency in daily use, but it is exclusive to the industrial market and handled only by companies and government. This effectively separates the economy into two isolated halves. By its nature, regular money cannot interact with the social economy, but it is used conventionally in the industrial market as a means of exchange and value.

### The Commons

The *commons* is effectively its own economy, though it contributes the majority of value to the overall financial system. Almost all Vekllei people are employed in it through social roles in a formal capacity. Despite its odd nature, it produces value in ways comparable to overseas economies of a similar size.

The *commons* comprises mostly service industries, which account for about four fifths of its output. The Vekllei civil service further accounts for about 10 per cent of these workers, but they are dispersed throughout their cascading federal system at different levels of government.

Vekllei workers are better educated on average than neighbouring developed economies, and about two fifths of of Vekllei people hold a tertiary qualification. This has become a comparative advantage in knowledge-based and high-skill industries, and contributes to the versatility of the overall economy. The country also recruits skilled foreigners through its prestigious university system, and for decades maintained pathways to immigration for educated people through the [[Century Society]] laws.

### The Industrial Market

The *industrial market* is distinguished from the *commons* by its use of money as part of trade. Certain types of companies are licensed to transact internationally, which represent the bulk of Vekllei

Although the government plays a major role in the economy in a technical sense, most [government-owned businesses](state-industry) are functionally independent and maintain a marriage of convenience with the government because of the operational perils of the moneyless domestic market.

For the sake of clarity, it is easiest to think of the Vekllei economy as having seperate halves, which interact with each other through a body called the [International Market](finance). The moneyless domestic economy, where most people live and work, is called the *Commons* and is functionally isolated from direct international trade. The industrial economy,

Even compared to larger economies the Vekllei market is highly complex, because it incorporates different and sometimes opposed economic mechanisms simultaneously for different purposes.

Vekllei is a union of island communities, many of which are current and historic entrepôts. As a place of trade, Vekllei has extended its role into generating value-added revenues through manufacturing and refining goods into export products.

Although Vekllei has vast natural resources mostly located underwater around its islands, human labour is a uniquely precious resource in Vekllei and consequently the availability and satisfaction of workers are central to the health of the Vekllei economy.

Rather than a single intact market under universal legislation and currency, it is easier to think of the Vekllei economy as having seperate parts that have fundamentally different characteristics. The primary distinction is between the local, social markets and the industrial,
