**Federalisation** is the term for the process of integrating of a new country into the [[vekllei|Vekllei Commonwealth]]. It is a shorthand for all aspects of integration, including the construction of new buildings, ratification of new laws and accession to the Vekllei Constitution and the restructuring of the government. It concludes with the establishment of a commons and the abolishment of common money through a process of hyperinflation.

After the challenging federalisation of the Azores in the early 2020s, changes were made to the process to extend its length and reduce its immediate scope.
