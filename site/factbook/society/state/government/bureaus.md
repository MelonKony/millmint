A bureau is a statutory department of a [ministry](/ministries/) or [ministerial parliament](/parliaments/). They are professional, autonomous organisations run by a Director and staffed by civil servants.

They are typically large organisations with various degrees of devolution, and often control constituent commissions, boards or corporations.

Bureaus are organised into departments, which may comprise a number of offices. They are lead by an Executive Council, which typically includes a selection of staff from the Bureau as well as representatives from the ministry, industry or specific organisations from elsewhere in the {{<link/government>}}.
