The <span class="fi fi-min-vekllei-purple fis"></span> **Commonwealth Senate** is the upper house of the [[Vekllei]] [government](/government/) and has special legislative powers to approve, defer or reject proposed laws. The Senate cannot introduce most types of legislation, and so acts as a check on the [[assembly|Assemblies]], which collectively form a federated Lower House across 8 [constituent commonwealths](/constituents/).

Membership in the senate is proportional to the number of [constituent commonwealths](/constiuents/), which submit five members each.

The Senate is able to form Commonwealth Committees and Commissions, which engage in special inquiry of concern to the country. Although the results of these bodies are not legally binding, they have significant influence on government and the public and help draw attention to issues that have not recieved government or public notice.
