The Commonwealth Affairs Office is a body of the [[Ministry of Culture]] responsible for the documentation of the general disposition, welfare, culture and demography of the people in [[Vekllei]]. This includes political attitudes towards the Commonwealth itself, as well as how decisions made by other Secretariats impact public opinion. It is also the body-advocate of the public of member states who are unable to appeal to their local government directly.

#### Religious Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Religious Affairs Office* (COLSERE) is responsible for reporting religious trends across the Commonwealth, particularly as they intersect with religious infrastructure (places of worship and natural shrines) and organised religion. Its focus is mostly external, since the *Upen*'s animism in the Home Islands lacks conventional religious hierarchies. COLSERE also serves as an advisory body to COLSEC command and as reporting agency for discrimination and concerns of faith.
