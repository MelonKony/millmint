The <span class="fi fi-min-noshem fis"></span> **Commonwealth Intelligence Service** (*National Intelligence*, or *Noshem*) is the secret service of {{<link/vekllei>}} and the Commonwealth’s primary covert intelligence apparatus abroad. It is concerned with intelligence-gathering, surveillance and operations external to the Commonwealth. It is organised into 40 semiautonomous outlines, which each may operate several offices. Noshem's sophisticated intelligence network and broad mandate contribute to its legendary reputation abroad, and conspiracies of its presence in almost every country.

Noshem is unique in its broad recruitment of foreigners, many of whom are promised citizenship and residency in Vekllei. Many Noshem outlines recruit locally, and manage foreign assets through Vekllei-born supervisors.
