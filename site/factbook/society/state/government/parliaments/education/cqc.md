 The CQC is part of the {{<link/parliament-of-education>}}
{{</note>}}

<span class="fi fi-min-cqc fis"></span> **Commonwealth Curriculum & Qualifications Council** (CQC, colloquially *Quick*) develops and regulates the {{<link/vekllei>}} national curriculum and the Standard Exam. The organisation is headquartered in {{<link/antigua>}} but has offices in most Education Regions.

The CQC is politically independent of the {{<link/parliament-of-education>}} and {{<link/government>}}, and draws on the expertise of Vekllei educators through the {{<link/nef>}} to develop the national curriculum. It is updated each year, and Commonwealth schools are free to interpret its outlines independently as long as the requirements of each unit are met.
