The <span class="fi fi-min-nef fis"></span> **National Education Forum** is an industry organisation that represents teachers and educators in {{<link/vekllei>}}. It administers an annual conference each October, which provides recommendations to the {{<link/cqc>}} on changes to the Vekllei curriculum.

It is independent of the {{<link/parliament-of-education>}} and {{<link/government>}} and serves as a professional association for Vekllei teachers of all kinds. To this end, it also independently monitors working conditions and education standards in Vekllei schools.
