The Commonwealth Health Parliament is a [superior ministry](/parliaments/) of the {{<link/vekllei>}} {{<link/government>}}. It is lead by a First Secretary, who reports directly to the {{<link/cabinet>}}. In general, the Health Parliament legislates, finances and administers healthcare in Vekllei, particularly its comprehensive and universal public healthcare scheme.

The system is highly centralised, with rigid care and administrative standards that are applied across all levels of public health. Innovations in healthcare, including an electronic nationwide patient database, help efficiency and ease the burden of care on ward staff. Vekllei public health is recognised as a quality and equitable system, with good outcomes for patients in its care. Its accessibility and universality of care contribute greatly to standards of health and quality of life in Commonwealth society.

Broadly, the responsibilities of the Health Parliament include:

{{<note>}}
* Promotion of health throughout the country.
* Provision and administration of universal healthcare services.
* Provision of disability services and disability access.
* Regulation of private healthcare providers, medicines and policy.
* Medical and pharmaceutical research.

The Parliament of Health is led by the State Secretary of Health, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Secretary of Health.

Universal healthcare is provided by the {{<link/bureau-of-public-health>}}, which operates most hospitals and clinics in Vekllei. Administration and policy is conducted by the {{<link/bureau-of-health-services>}}, which is subject to regulation and policy by the Parliament and {{<link/health-democracy-commission>}}.

As a founding promise of the 4th Commonwealth and its acceding members, healthcare has been prioritised since independence and received continuous investment and improvement. Vekllei's public system has an abundance of staff and beds, and Vekllei medical professionals often volunteer in aid missions as a rite of passage. As a direct consequence of this parliament, life expectancy in Vekllei has risen from 75 to nearly 85 in forty years.
