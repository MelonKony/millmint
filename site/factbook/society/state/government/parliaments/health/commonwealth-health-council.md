The <span class="fi fi-min-health fis"></span> **Commonwealth Health Council** facilitates the operation of the public health system as the superior administrative body. It advises the Office of Public Health and contributes to its decision-making. It also maintains the administrative services required for the national health system, including personnel departments, tribunals and liaisons for the [Health Accounting Office](#health-accounting-office). In effect, it unites the whole system under a single chain of command, ensuring consistent practice and policy across the entire country.

The National Health Council also promotes healthy living and disease prevention to the public through programmes in the home, school and workplace.

## Vekllei Health Network

The Vekllei Health Network (VHN) is the body that actually supplies and supports public health facilities. It connects individual hospitals, clinics and GPs with the Health Parliament, and arranges the logistics to ensure their function.

Each constituent and republic has its own Local Health Network, which cascade in a decentralised system to ensure universal coverage. The VHN is divided into six regions at a federal level.

The VHN also links the public health system with industry boards, councils and accreditors. These councils advise the VHN directly to make process changes, bypassing the bureaucracy of the National Health Council.
