The <span class="fi fi-min-landscape fis"></span> **Ministry of Landscape** is a [devolved ministry](/ministries/) of the {{<link/government>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It serves a broad role in government in matters related to agriculture, food security, natural resources, meteorology, nature and the oceans. In this sense, the ministry is tasked with "landscape" as it is used in Vekllei, with resource exploitation and human settlements assigned to the {{<link/ministry-of-industry>}} and the {{<link/ministry-of-the-commons>}} respectively.

Although the ministry has many environmental and conservationist responsibilities, it is not strictly an environmental ministry. Instead, its portfolio encompasses the physical landscape of Vekllei in a straightforward sense. This includes weather monitoring, food production, pollution control, natural spaces and parks and natural bodies of water. It has a close relationship with the {{<link/LSRE>}}, the primary natural sciences research organisation in Vekllei. In many ways, the portfolio of research interests of the LSRE is the portfolio of duties of the Ministry of Landscape. Common responsibilities of the ministry include:

{{<note>}}
* Food production, security, distribution, and standards
* Biosecurity and quarantine domestically and internationally
* Management of agriculture and fisheries
* Management of national parks, commonwealth land, and sovereign natural spaces
* Meteorology, weather forecasting and natural disaster preparation
* Landcare, land conservation, education and promotion of the natural sciences
* Hydrography of Vekllei territorial waters and exclusive economic zones
* Facilitating research and development of relevant sciences through constituent research organisations

The Ministry of Landscape is led by the State Secretary of Landscape, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Minister of Landscape.

Vekllei is a megadiverse country, owing to its distant and transpolar and territories that often comprise isolated and unique ecosystems. As such, the ministry is highly devolved and has an established presence in every Vekllei republic. Where other ministries are tied closely to the populations of Vekllei people, the Ministry of Landscape has a much broader interest in the physical makeup of Vekllei territories and as such may often make up the largest Commonwealth presence in many smaller [constituent republics](/republics/).

Because it is well-funded and staffed, the ministry produces tremendous amounts of useful economic and scientific data about the unique environments of Vekllei. Through its constituent research establishment, the {{<link/LSRE>}}, it is one of the foremost contributors to environmental sciences in the world.
