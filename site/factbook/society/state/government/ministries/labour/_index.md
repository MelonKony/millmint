{{</note>}}

The <span class="fi fi-min-labour fis"></span> **Ministry of Labour** is a [devolved ministry](/ministries/) of the {{<link/government>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It provides a general role in registering and legislating the Vekllei workforce, which serves a unique role in Vekllei's participatory economy.

The ministry serves traditional functions in establishing workplace standards and safety legislation, but also maintains the *[consosva](/consosva/)* and *[corsosva](/corsosva/)* systems, which outline the legal obligations for employment and civic conscription respectively. To this end, the Ministry of Labour is an organiser of essential work in Vekllei, as well as a general administrator of worker protections, industrial relations and migrant integration. Common responsibilities of the ministry include:

{{<note>}}
* Compiling labour statistics and registers of employment for use in policy
* Ensuring compliance with Vekllei workplace standards
* Handling employment in compliance with the [Consosva](/consosva/) principles and laws
* Organising manpower and conscription in the [Corsosva](/corsosva/) system
* Facilitating collective bargaining and labour relations
* Hearing and prosecuting violations of labour standards, including anti-discrimination laws
* Facilitating training and skill-building in Vekllei workplaces

The Ministry of Labour is led by the State Secretary of Labour, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Minister of Labour.

The ministry is highly devolved, and although its policy is subordinated to federal legislation, devolved branches of the ministry generally reflect their local economies and have different political priorities. In developing Vekllei republics, for example, transition to the *Commons* social economy requires regular intervention by the ministry. In developed moneyless economies like the {{<link/kalina>}} and {{<link/volcanic>}}, the ministry targets training and unemployment as priorities.
