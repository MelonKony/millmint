 The CER is part of the {{<link/ministry-of-labour>}}
{{</note>}}

The **Commonwealth Employment Register** (CER) is a functional body of the {{<link/ministry-of-labour>}} that records occupations of Vekllei citizens. Since Vekllei people have a legal obligation to be occupied in some capacity, a term which includes education and housework, the CER maintains a database of registered occupations that ensures compliance and provides useful economic data to the {{<link/government>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. In this sense, the CER has a close relationship with the {{<link/bureau-of-statistics>}}.

The CER serves only an administrative and clerical role, and does not submit policy or provide enforcement for legal obligations. Although it is a useful resource of the Labour Ministry, it primarily facilitates self-reporting from Vekllei citizens. It is headquartered in {{<link/virgin>}}, but is networked with identical databases in {{<link/oslola>}}.
