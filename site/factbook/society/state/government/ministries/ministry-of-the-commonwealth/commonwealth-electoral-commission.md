The *Commonwealth Electoral Commission* (CEC) conducts elections, by-elections and referendums in Vekllei. It also maintains the Vekllei Electoral Roll, and designs electorates, apportionments and redistributions in the Home Islands.

The Electoral Commission also negotiates the registration of political candidates and their funding through the Public Visibility Scheme, in collaboration with the Ministry of the Commonwealth general office. In addition, the Commission provides electoral supervisory services to other Commonwealth member-states and, occasionally, monitors foreign elections as an independent auditor as part of the Interior Government's overseas political commitments.
