The <span class="fi fi-min-transport-labs fis"></span> **Commonwealth Transport Laboratories** (CTL) conducts research to benefit the [[Vekllei]] national transport network. Although a lot of this research relates to the existing operation of their commuter systems, it also includes development of new routes and machines that may benefit accessibility and efficiency of transport in the country.

In this sense, CTL outlines the shape and future of Vekllei transport in a comprehensive fashion. It lacks the resources to develop prototypes itself, and so commissions other industrial and government partners. Examples include the *Coral*-series electric multiple units for [[CommRail]], which were developed by the Atlantic Works to specifications provided by CTL.

CTL has a close working relationship with the [[Transport Commission]], which uses its findings to develop transport policy. Much of CTL's regular work involves passenger surveys and network studies that monitor passenger load, experience and efficiency. The main laboratory and head office of the CTL is located in [[Aismious]].
