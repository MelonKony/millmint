The <span class="fi fi-min-housing-commission fis"></span> **Commonwealth Housing Commission** designs, constructs and manages municipalised tenanted housing as part of the [[Bureau of Housing]] in [[Vekllei]].

Although most Vekllei people own their homes, home-ownership varies across resident status, employment, and different [republics](/republics/). To incentivise employment in some sectors like the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] and [[Healthcare]], the Vekllei government attaches desirable housing to employment. Similarly, a claim to home ownership takes time to justify, and so many migrants and young people remain tenants. In both cases, tenanted housing is provided by the housing commission, which acts as a landlord for the purposes of ensuring a minimum standard of housing access.
