The <span class="fi fi-min-art-commission fis"></span> **Commonwealth Art Commission** (CAC) manages government programmes in [[Vekllei]] that promote and commission the visual arts. In contrast to other arts promotion boards, the Commission employs and commissions artists directly without an intermediary, and also coordinates the development of the visual arts in Vekllei society via the construction of galleries and promotion of public arts education. Through the Commission and its programmes, an enormous body of public art has been built, and includes murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts.

The Commission provides only general direction on art it commissions, but does direct its promotion and its use in public benefit. This includes sculptures and paintings for public buildings, art books, gallery showings and classes to introduce and train the public in visual arts. Its most famous programme in Vekllei is the [[National Design Atlas]], an annual design publication distributed freely to every Vekllei household.

The Commission operates three programmes dedicated to aspects of its mission, through which it employs about 8,000 artists and a number of other people involved in its promotion and instruction. The scale and resourcing of the Commission contributes significantly to Vekllei's total artistic output, and has produced a number of famous artists, photographers and craftsmen.
