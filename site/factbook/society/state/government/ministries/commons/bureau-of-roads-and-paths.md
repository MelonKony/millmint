The <span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> **Bureau of Roads & Paths** performs road maintenance in {{<link/vekllei>}}. Vekllei cities are dense and few people own cars, so much of the work performed by the bureau deals with pedestrian streets and pathways, rather than traditional roads that meet automotive specification. It nonetheless also performs a traditional in road and motorway construction and maintenance, and generally builds land transport connections not under the purview of the {{<link/bureau-of-rail>}}.

The bureau is also responsible for the licensing and registration of motor vehicles, as well as public vehicle initiatives like motorpools. It operates crash testing facilities in {{<link/barbados>}}.
