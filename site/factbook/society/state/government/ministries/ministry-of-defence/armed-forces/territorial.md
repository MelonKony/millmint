## Overview

The <span class="fi fi-min-defence fis"></span> **Armed Forces of the Commonwealth** are the military of [[Vekllei]], and a constituent armed component of the [[Ministry of Defence]]. They comprise the combined armed services of the country, as well as capabilities for public emergencies, law enforcement and civil defence.

Unlike common practice overseas, Vekllei does not have seperate military branches, and instead administers all aspects of defence as a single armed organisation originating as part of the navy, a term which is still used generally to describe all military services. As a union of island communities, the Vekllei Navy is its historic and contemporary primary means of defence, and Vekllei doctrine favours an integrated command. As such, all air and land warfare is conducted as part of the Navy under a unified defence command.[^navy]

Because all services operate within the Navy, different roles are organised into different services. For example, the traditional surface navy of the [Maritime Service](#maritime-service) does not operate its own seaborne aviation, since all aircraft are part of the Navy's [Air Service](#air-service). In this context, "Navy" is a synonym for "Military" in Vekllei, and equipment, signage and vehicles are marked as such.

## Vekllei Armed Services

A Vekllei military service is a component of the overall armed forces, and so they overlap and intersect. Unlike most other militaries, which are divided between different branches and coordinated by a central command, Vekllei military services are effectively interchangeable, and form *interarmes services* for specific missions. A single *interarmes service* may even involve regiments from all services simultaneously, which would operate as a single unit under a unified command.

Vekllei is a seagoing country of island communities, and so the Marine Services are the backbone of its strategic forces. They are the oldest military organisations of Vekllei and revered by the country.

**Note**

In numbered Vekllei services (e.g. Terrestrial & Air Services, etc.), numerical order is preserved and units are not permanently identified by a particular number. Unit numbers are administrative and assist in formation of interarmes services, so units may change numbers regularly. Instead, unit identity and honours are attached to ceremonial and historical names that remain with the unit.

## <span class="navicon">üó°Ô∏è</span> Land and Army Services

The Vekllei **Territorial Service** is the closest component to a conventional army in the Vekllei armed forces, and comprises the majority of its professional fighting force. All Rifles regiments are trained as marine infantry, and Vekllei does not maintain dedicated marine regiments. All Territorial regiments are a part of the [Commonwealth Guard](#commonwealth-guard) and are federalised the same way, but are distinguished by their professional service and expeditionary posture.

In Vekllei, military units are roughly organised as 'regiments' of 1,000 men and 'sections' of 100.

**Organisation**

Vekllei has a professional combat army of around 45,000 soldiers, 6,000 of which are commandos that suit its expeditionary and interventionist strategic posture.

Including the Guards and Popular Guards, which serve roles as reservists and partisan militias respectively, that number exceeds a million during wartime.

### Commonwealth Rifles

Rifles regiments consist of 1,000 men, and can be assembled into larger divisional units. Regiment numbers are administrative only and so can change, and regiments are identified with inherited names with honours instead. All Rifles servicemen are also part of a Guards regiment as per the Vekllei federal militia system. Rifles are mechanised with armoured cars.

Policy is to have a standing army 35,000 strong, but Rifles regiments are activated as they are combat-ready, and so the 19th and 20th are often deactivated between training.

### Commonwealth Commandos (6,000)

 Commandos in Vekllei are highly trained, professional soldiers with an expeditionary character. While often trained for remote and tactical combat, they are also commonly used to lead interarmes services that include regular rifle infantry.

  The 1st-3rd commandos include regional special forces sections for polar, equatorial and lunar warfare. The 6th specialises in unconventional and psychological warfare.

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Federal Components</summary>

Commonwealth components are the federal militia and primary reserve force of the Territorial Services. It is federalised by default, and contributes its servicemen for the Rifles and other territorial regiments. As such, all Territorial servicemen are part of a Commonwealth Guards regiment, but in regular service are assigned to active units in other services. Only reservists, trainees and officers remained attached to the Guard while it is federalised.

Guards units are numbered in context to their home [republic](/republics/), i.e. [[Oslola]] has Guards regiments numbering 1st-12th.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Popular Guards</summary>

The Popular Guards are the volunteer militia groups found across the country. They reflect the Vekllei concept of the citizen-soldier, and are distinct from regular guards/reservists by their level of training and organisation. They are strictly volunteer, and are raised and organised by gendarmes of the [[Police of the Parliament]]. They number perhaps a million if mobilised totally, and would function as a saboteur and partisan force in the event of war.
