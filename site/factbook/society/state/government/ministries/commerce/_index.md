The <span class="fi fi-min-commerce fis"></span> **Ministry of Commerce** (COSMOSOL) conducts government spending and facilitates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the {{<link/vekllei>}}, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the {{<link/commbank>}}) occurs through its subordinate bureaus and organisations. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:

{{<note>}}
* Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government '[White Bonds](/factbook/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#white-bonds)' and Commonwealth Bank '[Blue Bonds](/factbook/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#blue-bonds)'
* Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus
* Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade
* Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets
* Printing and transporting currency

The Ministry of Commerce is led by the State Secretary of Commerce, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Minister of Commerce.

Most of the functions of the ministry are conducted by the {{<link/treasury>}}, which oversees most economic planning and operates the vast computerised systems that functionally run the Vekllei domestic market.

Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.
