 This *[ministry](/ministries/)* is part of {{<link/vekllei>}}
{{</note>}}

The <span class="fi fi-min-defence fis"></span> **Ministry of Defence** is responsible for the {{<link/armed-forces>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}, as well as its civil defence organisations that include both its police services and emergency response capabilities. In this sense, the Ministry of Defence exercises both a military and civilian role, and its devolved nature under Commonwealth federalism means it has a broad mandate between [republics](/republics/).

The ministry in peacetime does not exercise command authority of its constituent organisations directly, as the military and civil defence forces are autonomous organisations. Common responsibilities of the ministry include:

{{<note>}}
* Development of defence policy and planning.
* Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the armed forces.
* Equipment procurement and administration.
* Conducting scientific military research.
* Policing and security of Vekllei republics, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.
{{</note>}}

The Ministry of Defence is led by the State Secretary of Defence, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Minister of Defence.

Aspects of Vekllei's police and military are devolved, and the ministry has a key role in coordinating them centrally and establishing standards of service.
