The *Police of the Parliament* (also National Police, or VENOPOR) are the national and paramilitary police of Vekllei, responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection. The VENOPOR is made up of a variety of organisations dedicated to specialised and tactical forms of policing unavailable to the [Police of the Public](#police-of-the-public). As a paramilitary force, the VENOPOR are also trained to support the [Crown Armed Forces](/factbook/society/state/palace/military/) in wartime, and coordinate broad mobilisation in the event of a defensive war.

VENOPOR jurisdiction is organised within the individual theatre commands of the Crown Armed Forces. {{<link/kala>}}, the Antilles and the Vekllei and Kalina Islands maintain their own VENOPOR police forces, and other Commonwealth members and territories are dependent on Vekllei Islands policing.
