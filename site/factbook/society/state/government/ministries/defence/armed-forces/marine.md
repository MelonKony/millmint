The <span class="fi fi-min-marine fis"></span> **Marine Services** comprise a number of military services that are part of the {{<link/armed-forces>}} of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is a conceptual distinction, since vital components of naval warfare (including naval aviation and naval infantry) are part of the air and {{<link/territorial>}} respectively. Instead, 'marine services' refer broadly to the military organisations that primarily operate watercraft or coastal artillery, in the fashion of a traditional navy, coast guard or coastal fortification.

These marine services include:

* **The Maritime Service**, the historic naval component of Vekllei
* **The Littoral Service**, the coast guard
* **The Coastal Artillery Service**, which constructs and operates coastal fortifications

The marine services are supported by a number of naval stations which provide facilities to dock, refurbish and construct vessels. They can also incorporate a number of other military functions, like air bases, training centres, radar stations and research facilities. Because of the variety of vessels in the marine services, many stations specialise in the maintenance of certain classes of ship, which are then known as "home stations" even if they are not their home port.

## Maritime Service

The **Maritime Service** (the traditional **Navy** or *Navy of the Public*) is the traditional naval warfare component of the Vekllei military and consists of its surface ships and submarines. It comprises three fleets and an auxiliary service, that functions similarly to a republican or federal militia.

The Home Fleet (also *Auxiliary Fleet*) of the Commonwealth Maritime Service is an auxiliary fleet stationed across the 70 island city-states that make up the country. Each Vekllei city-state serves as a home port to a particular frigate. While they serve a ceremonial role, they are active warships that perform littoral maritime security duties and can be federalised into other fleets as necessary. The Home Fleet also consists of vessels with a multi-fleet or multipurpose role, and can be reassigned to other fleets as required.

## Littoral Service

The **Littoral Service** (the *Coast Guard* or *Navy of the Parliament*) is the maritime security component of the Vekllei military. It provides customs, policing and search and rescue services for Vekllei's territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, though it frequently patrols international waters in the Atlantic.

The Littoral Service has 12 commands across the Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic and Caribbean Oceans, including the entirety of the Vekllei exclusive economic zone and territorial waters. It has a broad mandate reflected in the vessels under its command, which range from heavily armed frigates to small watercraft and survey ships. It also has an air component provided by the Air Service.
