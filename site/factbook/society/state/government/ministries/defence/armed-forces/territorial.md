## Overview

The <span class="fi fi-min-defence fis"></span> **Armed Forces of the Commonwealth** are the military of {{<link/vekllei>}}, and a constituent armed component of the {{<link/ministry-of-defence>}}. They comprise the combined armed services of the country, as well as capabilities for public emergencies, law enforcement and civil defence.

Unlike common practice overseas, Vekllei does not have seperate military branches, and instead administers all aspects of defence as a single armed organisation originating as part of the navy, a term which is still used generally to describe all military services. As a union of island communities, the Vekllei Navy is its historic and contemporary primary means of defence, and Vekllei doctrine favours an integrated command. As such, all air and land warfare is conducted as part of the Navy under a unified defence command.[^navy]

Because all services operate within the Navy, different roles are organised into different services. For example, the traditional surface navy of the [Maritime Service](#maritime-service) does not operate its own seaborne aviation, since all aircraft are part of the Navy's [Air Service](#air-service). In this context, "Navy" is a synonym for "Military" in Vekllei, and equipment, signage and vehicles are marked as such.

## Vekllei Armed Services

A Vekllei military service is a component of the overall armed forces, and so they overlap and intersect. Unlike most other militaries, which are divided between different branches and coordinated by a central command, Vekllei military services are effectively interchangeable, and form *interarmes services* for specific missions. A single *interarmes service* may even involve regiments from all services simultaneously, which would operate as a single unit under a unified command.

Vekllei is a seagoing country of island communities, and so the Marine Services are the backbone of its strategic forces. They are the oldest military organisations of Vekllei and revered by the country.

{{<note link>}}
**Note**

In numbered Vekllei services (e.g. Terrestrial & Air Services, etc.), numerical order is preserved and units are not permanently identified by a particular number. Unit numbers are administrative and assist in formation of interarmes services, so units may change numbers regularly. Instead, unit identity and honours are attached to ceremonial and historical names that remain with the unit.

### <span class="navicon">⚓️</span> Marine Services

The Marine Services consist of the armed forces most commonly associated with seaborne warfare and supply, and include equivalents to the Navy and Coast Guard. It is an administrative rather than conceptual distinction, as many other aspects of oceangoing warfare are folded into the air and territorial services, such as naval aviation and marine infantry.

<details>
<summary>Maritime Service</summary>

The **Maritime Service** (the **Navy** or *Navy of the Public*) is the traditional naval warfare component of the Vekllei military and consists of its surface ships and submarines. It comprises three fleets and an auxiliary service, that functions similarly to a republican or federal militia.

<details>
<summary>Commonwealth Fleet</summary>

The Commonwealth Fleet (*Sovereign/Federal Fleet*) of the Vekllei Maritime Service is the largest naval formation in Vekllei and is tasked with defence of the country's central corridor, a triangular area with points in {{<link/oslola>}}, {{<link/costa-verde>}} and {{<link/summers>}}. It is

<summary>Home Fleet (Auxiliary)</summary>

The Home Fleet (also *Auxiliary Fleet*) of the Commonwealth Maritime Service is an auxiliary fleet stationed across the 70 island city-states that make up the country. Each Vekllei city-state serves as a home port to a particular frigate. While they serve a ceremonial role, they are active warships that perform littoral maritime security duties and can be federalised into other fleets as necessary. The Home Fleet also consists of vessels with a multi-fleet or multipurpose role, and can be reassigned to other fleets as required.

### <span class="navicon">✈️</span> Aeronautical & Astronautical Services

The Aeronautical & Space Services include the air supremacy, interception and defence elements, as well as services to supply and equip them. They also consist of the missile and air detection elements of the armed forces.

<details>
<summary>Air Service</summary>

The **Air Service** conducts aerial warfare in {{<link/vekllei>}}. It consists of three commands that specialise in different aspects of air support and supremacy. The Air Service is also a major contributor to other services, since marine and territorial doctrines depend heavily on the air service for their combat capability, combat support, transport, logistics and reconnaissance.

Vekllei has a rapid air-mobile posture across its armed forces, which is facilitated by the relative size and availability of its air service. It is also the only service in which women are a majority of participants in combat, since female pilots contribute just over 52% of its servicemen.

**Structure**

There are three commands in the Air Service, which in the secular Vekllei tradition have specific and exclusive functions. The Air Combat Command comprises all primary offensive squadrons including fighters, helicopters and scouts. The Air Auxiliary Command comprises miscellaneous aviation including search and rescue, training and replenishment. The Air Transport Command provides transport for both logistics and combat organisations.

### <span class="navicon">🗡️</span> Land and Army Services

<details>
<summary>Territorial Service</summary>

The Vekllei **Territorial Service** is the closest component to a conventional army in the Vekllei armed forces, and comprises the majority of its professional fighting force. All Rifles regiments are trained as marine infantry, and Vekllei does not maintain dedicated marine regiments. All Territorial regiments are a part of the [Commonwealth Guard](#commonwealth-guard) and are federalised the same way, but are distinguished by their professional service and expeditionary posture.

In Vekllei, military units are roughly organised as 'regiments' of 1,000 men and 'sections' of 100.

**Organisation**

Vekllei has a professional combat army of around 45,000 soldiers, 6,000 of which are commandos that suit its expeditionary and interventionist strategic posture.

Including the Guards and Popular Guards, which serve roles as reservists and partisan militias respectively, that number exceeds a million during wartime.

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Rifles</summary>

Rifles regiments consist of 1,000 men, and can be assembled into larger divisional units. Regiment numbers are administrative only and so can change, and regiments are identified with inherited names with honours instead. All Rifles servicemen are also part of a Guards regiment as per the Vekllei federal militia system. Rifles are mechanised with armoured cars.

Policy is to have a standing army 35,000 strong, but Rifles regiments are activated as they are combat-ready, and so the 19th and 20th are often deactivated between training.

* **Rifles Regiments**
  * 1st-20th Rifles Regiments
* **Aerorifles Regiments**
  * 21st-24th Aerorifles Regiments
* **Marine Rifles Regiments**
  * 25th-32nd Marine Rifles Regiments
* **Special Warfare Regiments**
  * 33rd Chemical Regiment
  * 34th Nuclear Regiment
* **Armoured Rifles Regiments**
  <br>
  The Armoured Rifles are mechanised with infantry fighting vehicles and function as shock infantry.
  * 35th-36th Armoured Rifles Regiments
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Commandos</summary>

 Commandos in Vekllei are highly trained, professional soldiers with an expeditionary character. While often trained for remote and tactical combat, they are also commonly used to lead interarmes services that include regular rifle infantry.

  The 1st-3rd commandos include regional special forces sections for polar, equatorial and lunar warfare. The 6th specialises in unconventional and psychological warfare.

* **Commandos Regiments**
  * 1st-3rd Commandos Regiments
  * 4th Airborne Commandos Regiment
  * 5th Marine Commandos Regiment
  * 6th Special Activities Regiment
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Javelins</summary>

  Javelin regiments are the Vekllei name for armoured units, and represent the bulk main battle tank force. They are designed to operate with rifles regiments in interarmes formations.

**Javelin Regiments**
* 1st-2nd Javelin Regiments
* 3rd Javelin Scouts Regiment

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Federal Components</summary>

Commonwealth components are the federal militia and primary reserve force of the Territorial Services. It is federalised by default, and contributes its servicemen for the Rifles and other territorial regiments. As such, all Territorial servicemen are part of a Commonwealth Guards regiment, but in regular service are assigned to active units in other services. Only reservists, trainees and officers remained attached to the Guard while it is federalised.

Guards units are numbered in context to their home [republic](/republics/), i.e. {{<link/oslola>}} has Guards regiments numbering 1st-12th.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Popular Guards</summary>

The Popular Guards are the volunteer militia groups found across the country. They reflect the Vekllei concept of the citizen-soldier, and are distinct from regular guards/reservists by their level of training and organisation. They are strictly volunteer, and are raised and organised by gendarmes of the {{<link/parliament-police>}}. They number perhaps a million if mobilised totally, and would function as a saboteur and partisan force in the event of war.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Commonwealth Security Service</summary>

The Commonwealth Security Service is the military police of the territorial service, and primarily provides base security, military intelligence and policing for enlisted servicemen.

**Security Service Regiments**
* 1st Parliamentary Security Regiment
* 2nd Industrial Security Regiment, {{<link/ministry-of-light-and-water>}}
* 3rd-4th Security Regiments
* 5th-6th Strategic Security Regiments
* 7th Security Intelligence Regiment
</details>

<details>
<summary>Commonwealth Patrol Service</summary>

The Patrol Service is the armed border guard of Vekllei. While all Vekllei borders are found at sea and involve the Littoral Service, the Patrol Service provides onshore security and policing.

Although the service is organised into regiments, their formations are better reflected by their regional sections.
