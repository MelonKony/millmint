The <span class="fi fi-min-light-and-water fis"></span> **Ministry of Light & Water** is responsible for water and electricity supply in {{<link/vekllei>}}. While the ministry primarily directs production and facilitates research, it also controls the vast majority of energy and water production in Vekllei through its statutory corporations.

Although electricity now flows freely and abundantly in an age of commercial fusion power plants, many of Vekllei's [constituent republics](/republics/) have little to no fresh water reserves and rely heavily on water conservation, recycling and desalination to supplement their water supply. Common responsibilities of the ministry include:

{{<note>}}
* Maintenance and operation of utilities that provide Vekllei people with electricity and water
* Facilitation of water and energy grid independence and security
* Production, promotion and conservation of energy and water
* Investment and research into emerging physical sciences
* Advising energy and water policy to [republican](/republics/) and [commonwealth](/constituents/) parliaments
* Investment and development of new electric and water sources
* Nuclear energy research and security

The Ministry of Light & Water is the third-largest ministry by persons employed, and its subordinate bureaux and corporations are responsible for a number of iconic pieces of Vekllei infrastructure, including the [Expo '74 Experimental Reactor](/posts/2019-09-15-reactor/) and the [Ou Hydroburo Complex](/posts/2020-04-21-hydro/). It is lead by the State Secretary of Light & Water, who is a member of the {{<link/cabinet>}}. It is represented in the {{<link/council>}} by the First Minister of Light & Water.

The ministry is organised around electricity and water production respectively, but also has statutory bodies for emergencies, security and nuclear science research. The ministry was a pioneer in the construction the first and second commercial fusion power plants in {{<link/oslola>}} and {{<link/kairi>}}, which were among the first in the world to provide fusion-generated electricity to households.
