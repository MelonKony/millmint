**Corsosva** (a portmanteau of Oslolan *corsivis sovis*, lit. "*compulsory service*") is the period of civic conscription that applies to all Vekllei citizens. It requires four years of service, served between the ages of 18-32. Although administered by the [Department of Compulsory Service](/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/#department-of-compulsory-service) of the [Ministry of Defence](/ministry-of-defence/), most citizens perform civilian or industrial work during Corsosva, and only a minority enter the armed forces as conscripts.

Individuals entering Corsosva elect their preferences for service, which are then weighted based on experience and ability. The most common forms of Corsosva are in construction, education and healthcare.
