<span class="fi fi-min-atlantic-works fis"></span>  **Atlantic Works** is an intermunicipal cooperative business in [[Vekllei]] that designs and manufactures heavy equipment and machinery. It comprises a number of constituent workshops ranging from individuals in sheds to large firms with established factories and design teams. About 200 factories, dockyards and manufacturies are associated with the cooperative, which together contribute substantially to engineering independence and sovereignty, as its constituent workshops produce domestic alternatives to hundreds of machines, products and electrical equipment.

Prior to the war and the founding of the [[Vekllei|4th Commonwealth]], Atlantic Works was a vertically integrated multinational corporation headquartered in [[Oslola]]. At the height of its power, Atlantic Works represented ten per cent of specialised machinery engineering in Europe, and specialised in factory tooling and heavy machinery. The company was municipalised in the Commonwealth period, and effectively broken up into a dozen constituent workshops across the new constituent republic of Oslola.

Today, Atlantic Works specialises in industrial, electrical, aerospace and vehicle engineering as well as a variety of consumer and commercial machinery. Famous products include the [Fairie](/stories/fairie/) seaplane and the *Coral*-series commuter trains found commonly throughout Vekllei.
