<span class="fi fi-min-federal-timekeeping fis"></span>  **Federal Timekeeping** (trading as **Federal**) is an intermunicipal cooperative watchmaker in [[Vekllei]]. It comprises about a dozen different watchmakers, each with their own specialisations, style and history. When producing timepieces for the government (as in the case of service watches or student graduation watches), the individual pieces are produced to a common spec and branded under the *Federal* label. Otherwise, constituent watchmakers generally retain their own branding.

Between the constituent watchmakers of Federal, almost every type of timepiece is represented. Halibut was the historic supplier of the Oslolan Navy and specialises mostly in pocket watches and a traditional house style of timepiece movements. Others, like Quartz, specialise in quartz oscillators and semi-electric wristwatches. [[Oslola]] and [[Kala]] have a tradition of watchmaking dating back centuries, but much of Federal machining and production now occurs in [[Velas]], where it is headquartered.

Timepiece and clock manufacturing is centralised on an industrial, automatic scale in [[Velas]], and so constituent watchmakers generally serve as designers. Hand-built watches, while especially desirable, are exceptionally rare in Vekllei and mostly available only to the members and families of the industry. Soothing the lost romance of the hand-built wristwatch is the general quality and availability of timepieces in Vekllei, which are widely available at no cost to the public and which are manufactured as rewards for service and success.

A small number of Federal wristwatches are exported each year, and Federal constituent watchmakers have close relationships with global watchmakers. They are highly sought after by enthusiasts but mostly unknown to the general public. All Federal movements currently meet the Swiss Chronometer Certificate.
