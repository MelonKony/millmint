<span class="fi fi-min-avro fis"></span> **Avro Auto** is an automotive manufacturer headquartered in the {{<link/kalina>}} island of {{<link/karu>}} in {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is a [municipal corporation](/municipal-industry/) that has been part of the city of Pitera for over 230 years, when it was founded as a coachworks in what was then the British colony of Karu.

Avro is the largest consumer automobile manufacturer in Vekllei, and makes a few different models of sedans, estate cars, utility vehicles and city cars for use in autopools and public service in the country. It was an early example of fully-automatic industry in Vekllei, and its assembly lines were fully robotic by the late 1970s. These days, the majority of its 1,600 employees work in design, testing and engineering, and represent the best of Vekllei consumer automotive industrial design.

Avro cars are well liked because they are generally overbuilt compared to foreign autos. Aggressive standardisation in Avro engines, transmissions and drivetrains give even city cars a light, sporty quality. As a result, they are frequently crashed by unprepared drivers.

Avro only sells spare parts directly; it otherwise sells automobiles directly to autopools and industrial and government customers. Only around 10% of Vekllei people have a drivers license, and so their most common experience riding in an Avro is sitting in the passenger seat.

The most popular Avro model is the GTV, a sports sedan used by government and the police, as well as the Avro 100, a compact 2-door city car found commonly in autopools.
