The <span class="fi fi-min-ratings fis"></span> **Commonwealth Ratings Corporation** (CRC) is an independent credit rating agency in [[Vekllei]] that publishes research on tradeable securities in the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|Commsec]]. It is an independent [government corporation](/state-industry/) supervised by the [[Bureau of Securities]]. It is one of the largest ratings agencies in the world, and is popular as an offshore, impartial alternative to other agencies mostly located in the U.S. and [[UK]]. Its headquarters are located in the [[Caimanas]].

The CRC rates borrowers on a numerical scale between 1 (highest) and 25 (lowest). It also provides guidance on the financial outlook of public and private debtors.

The CRC also maintains the CRC/CSX 50, a float-adjusted index of the largest companies in the [[commonwealth-securities-exchange|Commsec]] by market cap, which is a popular alternative for foreign investors to the opaque and comprehensive CSX All Ordinaries Index.
