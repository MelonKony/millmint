<span class="fi fi-min-cosma fis"></span>  **Commonwealth Telecom** (better known by its trading name *Cosma*) is the national telecommunications provider in {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is responsible for providing connection and service to residential and public telephones in the country. It also develops a variety of consumer products including videophones, public phone booths, and personal phones.

Cosma also maintains telecommunications infrastructure networks internationally through **Cosma Overseas**, including the Oslola-Europe undersea cables and their sister sets between Vekllei and North America. Much of the network dates back over a hundred years, since a shortage of modern personal telephones in Vekllei requires Cosma to maintain a wide variety of voltage and cable standards.

Commercial, industrial and government telecommunications are managed by a seperate internal department called the **Industrial Telecommunications Office**.

Cosma was founded as a department of the {{<link/post>}} in 1926, but was spun off into its own company in the postwar period. Today, it serves nearly 22 million customers across Vekllei and abroad. It is headquartered in {{<link/summers>}}, which is also the site of the Transatlantic Interchange managed by the company.
