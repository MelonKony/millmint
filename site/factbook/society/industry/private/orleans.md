The <span class="fi fi-min-orleans fis"></span> **Orleans Steelworks** S.A. is a large integrated steelworks in [[Vekllei]], located in the republic of [[Soualiga]]. It is the third-largest integrated steel mill in the country, and occupies a compact 800 acre site on Steel Island in a brine lagoon in the town of Orleans. It produces around 1.5 million tonnes of steel per year from iron sourced mostly from Guinea and Mauritania. The company employs around 600 people, the majority of whom are locals on part-time contracts.

The company is one of the largest privately-owned heavy industrial concerns in Vekllei, and was founded by a prominent local Orleans family in the early postwar period as a means of securing Commonwealth investment in what is now the Soualiga Technical School and the island railway. Like all Vekllei heavy industry plants, it is heavily automated and most processes are roboticised.

The site is the largest single works in the republic, and comprises a number of units.

High levels of brine were recorded in Great Bay in 2056, which is adjacent to the mill's main works and saline ponds, and prompted a review of operations by the [[Bureau of Oceans]]. The investigation found brine contamination of waters around the mill had seriously damaged the surrounding marine ecosystem, and barriers were constructed to prevent the further contamination. The brine ponds were also moved away from the coastline. 

In 2060, the Orleans Steelworks celebrated its 40th birthday and erected an iron girder as a monument to the occasion in the capital of Marigot.
