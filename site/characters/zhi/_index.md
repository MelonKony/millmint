**Lin Zhi**, who prefers being addressed by her full name, is [Tzipora](/characters/tzipora/)'s friend and occasional accomplice. She is surly, independent and uninterested in the opinions of others. She meets Tzipora at [Moshel St School](/moshel/).

Like Tzipora, Zhi is a recent immigrant and despises her parents for uprooting her life to live in {{<link/vekllei>}}, from which she has retreated into traditionally Chinese cultural dress and signals. Tzipora is fascinated by her. Cobian and Coretti fear her.

<summary>Appearance</summary>

Lin Zhi is Chinese and has lived in Vekllei since she was 15. She speaks little Oslolan and mostly poor English. She has a serious face and round spectacles like Cobian, and brushes her long dark hair back. She maintains two unusual hair loops below her ears in braids, a style she has apparently invented herself.

Lin Zhi resents the burden of integration and demonstrates her foreignness through foreign styles, usually with traditional Chinese items or more contemporary Maoist fare. She wears loose Ku-style pants at home and school, which bear close similarity to Vekllei indigenous [rouisha](/posts/2021-06-11-mist/) trousers, usually with Vekllei or Chinese strap slippers. She has a weakness for jackets and cardigans, and never leaves her arms uncovered.

<summary>Personality</summary>

Lin Zhi is a girl under siege.

Tzipora first bonds with her over their social isolation as recent immigrants. Like Tzipora, Zhi speaks poor Oslolan and is deeply resentful of having to relocate to a foreign country. These poor language skills and deep anger are evident in her short, sharp speaking style and stern appearance.

She is sensitive to being made fun of, and considers many of her problems making friends to be racial in nature. Despite these emotional burdens, or perhaps because of them, Zhi is deeply loyal to her allies as long as they respect her social boundaries. Zhi is never the engine of conversation -- but she misses her friends when they're not there.
