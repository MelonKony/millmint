<summary>Appearance</summary>

Coretti is Vekllei-Congolese with dark skin and natural, short hair. She is slim, authentically pretty and graceful -- and has many admirers for it.

She is not particularly fashionable and does not need to be. This modesty enhances her natural charisma. Like Tzipora, she has some affection for [*Nuova Grotessco*](/posts/2021-07-21-fashion/) styles and unpretentious dresses and turtlenecks sweaters. She likes patterned clothing and owns many types, which she rotates regularly -- perhaps her only eccentricity.

<summary>Personality</summary>

Coretti's gentle good-naturedness leaves powerful impressions on all her meet her. She is the oldest of four sisters, and she applies these learned maternal qualities on her boyfriend's volatile friends, who are opinionated and passionate.

Her goodness does not preclude her from her own interests -- she adores music and good food, and unlike Lin Zhi, is more than willing to share the culture of her home country with her friends. She loves when gestures are reciprocated, a fact Tzipora learns quickly after teaching her how to cook Columbian food.

Despite her apparent differences in temperament with her boyfriend Moise, Coretti spends more time around vibrant hotheads than she does placid appeasers. Perhaps this is a behavioural legacy of growing up in a large, loud family. Maybe she is just attracted to big personalities. Either way, they appreciate her for it -- her voice of reason brings them all closer together.
