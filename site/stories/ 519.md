[[Vekllei]] is a sporty country, they like swimming, cricket and baseball, and perform well in all of them. They do well in fencing and shooting too, but don't have teams for a lot of sports (like equestrian dressing or rowing).

If [[Tzipora]] was two inches taller she could probably qualify for long jump, she's very good.
