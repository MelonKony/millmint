[[Vekllei]] has many different kinds of police across its islands, but these two are the most well-known. The Commonwealth cops (called Police of the Parliament) are famous for their sabre, which they are trained to use as a deterrent.

**Left:** Police of the Public, which are municipal police. They spend a lot of time walking around their neighbourhoods and sometimes carry a pistol, usually a revolver.

**Right:** Police of the Parliament, which are the paramilitary Commonwealth police. They represent federal interests. They are almost always armed, often with compact machine guns.

There are actually many other kinds of police in Vekllei, including the Federal Police and different types of special policing, but the most common are the Public and Parliament.
