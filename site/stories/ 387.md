Oslolans when the temperature hits 25°C.
{{</note>}}

[[Oslola]] is part of [[Vekllei]], and is known as Iceland in our own world. In this setting, the North Atlantic is a bit more temperate thanks to the Oslolan Low Pole and strong ocean currents. Still, they're acclimatised to cool air, and 25°C (77°F) is hot weather for them.
