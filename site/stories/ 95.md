I first saw this film at a low point in my life, and watching Shizuku discover her ability was one of the most touching things I've ever seen. I'm not a big fan-art guy, but I still find myself thinking about them years later and I wanted to paint them happy after the end of the film. Shizuku's got a second draft and Seiji's reading it for the first time (maybe not far from Cremona!)

I've imitated the animation style (I'm a clumsy digital artist, which is a pity since it's my only medium). You might even notice the character plates have their own shadow on the background.

I'm [@melon.kony](https://www.instagram.com/melon.kony/) on insta or you can find me at r/vekllei on reddit. Most of my art is very Ghibli in style.
