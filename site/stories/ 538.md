A lot of Persians live in the [[verde|Commonwealth Verde]], mostly descendants of Jungle Movement revolutionaries who fled after the first failed coup.

Although they are typically culturally rather than devoutly Islamic, they represent the largest muslim population in Vekllei's diverse Atlantic.

Vekllei is a secular country, but many of its constituent republics have state religions, and the federal government operates different religious institutions on behalf of communities.

The Levantine University in Praia is a good example, as a multifaith theological institution.
