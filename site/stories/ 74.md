The whole world gives way to a moment of silence. The other seasons are filled with noise and marrow, jerking and twisting with the pace of the clock. But a moment lasts forever — and wintertime is one long moment.

Although the uniforms got heavier and the commutes longer, Zelda would always like the wintertime. Even in the writhing digits of the city — the subways, the streetcars, the dockyards — snowbanks took the noise. There’s no hurry that time of year. Your feet are wet and your ears hurt, but that’s the price of liberation — to have normal productivity disrupted, usual play moved away. For one long moment — that’s winter — you can spent a while outdoors alone in the city.
