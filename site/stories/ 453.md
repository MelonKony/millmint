The No. 8 is the first new combat rifle to meet Commonwealth Ordinance specifications completely.
{{</note>}}

While Western Europe has wasted two decades trying to make caseless ammunition work, Vekllei has a simple, capable and comfortable standard rifle called the [[Cateral]] No. 8. The 8 shoots straight, every time.

It's a lightweight, simple rifle with great handling. It strips down to three large pieces, and is encased in smooth polymer so it won't catch on your kit. And it weighs less than the old one.
