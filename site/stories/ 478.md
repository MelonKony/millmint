Amka works as a glacial volcanologist, sleeps on a mattress in the back of her utility vehicle, eats military rations out of a bag for dinner and LOVES her job.

She is one of many volcanologists across [[Vekllei]] working for the [[LSRE]] (Land Science Research Establishment), which is a part of the national council of science establishments called [[SIRO]]. They do valuable work across Vekllei's many volcanic republics, and are integral to both Vekllei geoscience as well as protecting the lives of the millions of Vekllei people who live amidst volcanic activity.
