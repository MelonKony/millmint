Zero G is a hell of a thing.
{{</note>}}

The flight to the moon is long, loud and most people get sick, but it's also a life-changing experience.

The stewardess in pictured here is from {{<link/helena>}}. The use of [republic](/republics/) flags on uniforms is very common.

Vekllei has nearly 70 [republics](/republics/) and Vekllei people think of themselves as a union of city-states belonging to one country, so that kind of upstream and downstream federalism is a core part of their identity.

Politically, republics are also elevated as an identity because it decentralises power and identity between nearly 70 republics, rather than 8 regional commonwealths that might be more prone to secession or political antagonism as a rival and self-sufficient power.
