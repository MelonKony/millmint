"The Ziggurat" is the part of [[Noshem]] where the intelligence and analyst clerks work. The building and mural is pretty typical of Vekllei civic monumentalism.

Noshem is the Commonwealth Intelligence Service, a sprawling and well-resourced organisation with a reputation for deception and zealotry.
