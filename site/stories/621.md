Policing in [[Vekllei]] is often unusual. They can carry sabres instead of batons, regularly patrol sand banks and are armed with special revolver rifles chambered in the same .45 colt as their service weapon

These rifles are basically an extension of their sidearm, and are usually carried in the boot of a cruiser
