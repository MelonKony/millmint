There are lots of [[Vekllei]] construction templates on display here, built automatically by machines. These templates range from window frames to entire rooms, and are generally constructed by the [[National Construction House]].

Veletians generally live in compact homes furnished with simple conveniences. Kids often share their rooms (move out you bums).
