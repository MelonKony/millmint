Served hot or cold and packed with caffeine, milk tea is the national drink of [[Vekllei]]. 

Coffee might be more fashionable, especially among the kids, but milk tea is the comfort drink of millions of Atlantic and Caribbean people. Coffee is conspicuous; you drink it in public and with friends to show you're cosmopolitan and cool like an American. You can impress your classmates by showing preference for different brews.
