> In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster?<br>
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster<br>
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster<br>
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

The Special Activities Directorate is a branch of the Home Office at National Intelligence (HO/NI). It consists of men who have seen combat but are not otherwise career soldiers -- men who suit many environments well and are ideologically motivated.

The Directorate is dormant for most of the year. Its members have roles in other [[Noshem]] offices or work "on the outside." But when the time comes -- and it always does -- they'll be called in for jobs on the other side of the world. They are not just spooks, after all -- they serve a higher purpose, as the sword of Commonwealth ideology. In this context, they have no formal allegiances or masters, just essential values which they serve in espionage and violence.
