These Avia Sunjets are manufactured by [[Government Aircraft Factories]] for [[Commonwealth Airways]]. They're perfect for island-hopping routes throughout the Vekllei Caribbean, because their swing-wing design allows them to land on shorter island runways.

They are particularly beloved in [[Vekllei]] for their gorgeous sunroofs that line the roof of the cabin, which are UV-protected and able to change opacity.
