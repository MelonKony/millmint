I watched *Whisper of the Heart* again. Great movie.

I found *Whisper of the Heart* (1995) kind of cathartic. I think it's a really beautiful story about creativity and what you should do with your life. The weird 90s Japanese post-recession vibe is very strong too.

I wrote my thesis on spatiality in Studio Ghibli, which included visiting several locations that directly inspired the film. You can read that essay on this site here: [*A Universal Nostalgia*](/ghibli/).
