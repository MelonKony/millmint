She found a pademelon.
{{</note>}}

Pademelons were introduced to {{<link/oslola>}} by mistake, when they escaped from a friendship delegation in the 1950s.

A century on, they thrive in Oslola's cool, temperate rainforests, meaning that the island is the only place outside of Tasmania you can see these wallabies in the wild.
