[[Cobian]] is generally well dressed and coordinates her colours seasonally as they roll out through department stores. [[Tzipora]], despite being much more eccentric, is also more self-conscious and generally wears plain, neutral clothes.

Her domestic taste in clothes only ends up accentuating her intense way of speaking, characterised by thoughts that trail off and questions she asks herself in Spanish. She stares very intensely. You could never point this out to her because it would make her terribly insecure.

Cobian is an eccentric in her own way but only in the middle class idea of it. She has neuroses mostly inherited from her mother, but has basically nothing in common with Tzipora's anxious psychology

They like each other very much but have very little in common.
