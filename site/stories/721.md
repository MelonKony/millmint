Tzipora often makes dinner for her "father," [[Baron]] and her "friend," [[Cobian]]. We know her primarily as a goofball, but she's actually a really good cook and is a very sincere and hardworking person. This "hot plate" is a great example of modern Commonwealth cuisine.

They live in [[Oslola]], which we call Iceland, but you can see how federation has influenced what they eat. Tzipora has made salad from [[Lucaya]], drinks from [[Kalina]], flavoured rice from the [[Atlantic]] and lamb is a staple of the northern and southern Atlantic.
