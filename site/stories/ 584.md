The Commonwealth Marshals are one of the few security organisations in the country explicitly (in the setting) modelled after the US and US federalism. I guess they learned from the Ole Miss Riot of '62.

They've got the civilian appearance of the marshals but the equipment of the federalised National Guard called in to rescue them.
