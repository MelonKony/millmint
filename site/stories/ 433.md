Revision of the Vekllei school uniform hijab. It now fastens with a school crest pin.

Mostly for use among the Portuguese muslim community across [[Mira]] (Madeira) and the Azores. I'm not quite happy with this sketch, and I would like to include more Miran elements in future.

**Notes on Headscarves in Vekllei Schools**
<br>
Under the uniform code, only "veils" are permitted, which encompasses a range of headwear for various groups including Christian and Jewish orthodox communities. No face coverings are allowed.

Regarding Islamic head coverings, it's not a common issue because Miran muslims do not generally wear a Niqab or similar.
