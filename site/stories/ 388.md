[[Vekllei]] is of course a federalised Commonwealth, and so it has different kinds of policing for different kinds of laws. The array of cars on the left have jurisdiction related to the Commonwealth (smuggling, financial crime, mint security, intelligence liaisons, protection, etc.) and the cars on the right are administered by its republics (local law enforcement and regional policing).
