Astrid and Laura are junior inspectors for the [[Bureau of Housing]], which fields concerns from homeowners in municipalised homes.

In Vekllei, land "owns itself" as a seperate entity, and state and private ownership are a contract with that land. As such, land ownership is an overlapping claim by these three agents.

Inspectors like these assist courts by reporting the condition and stewardship of land, since stewardship (i.e. use, improvement and care of land) is often a determining factor of ownership.
