Vekllei operates the largest passenger ground-effect craft in the world, mostly linking the Azores to the Canaries and on trans-Caribbean routes. This is the [[Gull-Class]], a medium-sized ground-effect craft with room for 80.

They cruise around 4-500km/h and can fly up to 10 meters above the surface, allowing them to serve in poor weather.
