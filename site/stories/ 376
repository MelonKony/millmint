**Today we announce Vekllei 2.0**. This isn't one big thing. It's the accumulation of many small things that make up a big change. Vekllei 2.0 isn't a pivot to a whole new world -- everything is basically the same, and hopefully the stuff you like about it is intact. But it *is* smarter, better considered, and more realistic in its systems and respectful to its characters.

This post is also an excellent way to learn about this world for the first time, or reintroduce yourself to it if it's been a while -- please skip through this post to the parts you're interested in.

**Summary**
* Vekllei is now a federated commonwealth of Atlantic islands, rather than a single state situated in Iceland
* Many features of the country are now different, though their anarchist and democratic spirit remain intact
* It is lead by a directory of many prime ministers, rather than a single pair situated in Iceland
* Its common history derives from British colonial administration, and Vekllei is a postcolonial independent country
* The characters are much the same; Tzipora, Cobian, Moise and their friends still live in Oslola (what they call Iceland)

## What is Vekllei?

From the [Vekllei wiki](https://millmint.net/vekllei):

> Vekllei is best conceptualised as a union of islands across the Atlantic Ocean. It is a commonwealth, the fourth in a series, and consists of many island republics that are connected by politics and prosperity, not geography or race. These islands range in size from the Selvas Islands of 160 people to the island of Oslola, of 8 million. Together, they amount to a single superstate that spans the entirety of the Atlantic as a great power.

Vekllei is a union of islands in the Atlantic, and acts as single country federated by many constituent republics. These include our beloved *Oslola* (Iceland), where a lot of my art is set, but also includes Caribbean and North Atlantic countries as well.

Previously, Vekllei referred exclusively to Iceland and had a weird colonial thing going on with its overseas territories. This system was opaque and contradictory. Now it is straightforward and fairer -- Vekllei is the Commonwealth of Oceans, a union of oceangoing communities, and the Commonwealth government is not attached to any single island. In fact, the capital of Vekllei is on Comet, west of the Azores, in a federal zone outside the borders of any one constituent.

In other words, it is not a country bound by any one culture or language -- it is a new kind of country, founded on common civic ideals. Oslola's unique and interesting cultural features, like its language and Upen, still exist. But they do not dominate a government that rules over distant communities -- now they share equally in a federation of Atlantic peoples.

Vekllei arose from the British Atlantic Territories, a dominion of the former British Empire and administrative quirk of the colonial system that included many colonies including Oslola, the British Antilles and even the Falklands. So Vekllei is a sort of postcolonial successor to this dominion, but with a radically different purpose and system of government.

For some of you, it might have been a while since you've followed this project closely.

## Changes

Previously, what we called Vekllei was "Iceland," the city-state metropole that the project revolved around. What was weird was that there were about a dozen islands

**So what has changed?**

Vekllei -- an Algic inuit word meaning "people of the sea and stars," refers to the
