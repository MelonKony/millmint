Going out for drinks after work.
{{</note>}}

A bit of a time-skip from the usual chronology. Here, they're all 22 years old.

Lin Zhi is a junior photovolume engineer, and recovers holographic crystal memory used in Vekllei photo-electric computers.

Tzipora is a librarian at Seispri Municipal Library and is waiting for someone to compliment her new cardigan.

Cobian is a ward nurse at Seispri Hospital in the nuclear medicine wing.

They're going to the pub. Coretti is in a war in the Congo. Moise is in Indonesia working for a company whose name nobody can remember.
