Modern [[Vekllei]] policing is starts with the community. These cops from [[Cama]] know their neighbourhoods and the people in them. They're often seen arguing with local losers over coffee.

They serve the same role in Vekllei as they do pretty much anywhere, but their training is different. They stand close to perps on the street and speak to their face as people rather than threats.

The job is less law enforcement and more 'keepers of the peace.'

Their summery, British-style uniforms are quite distinct from [[Oslola]]'s cold-weather style.
