There are over 7,500 [[United Grocers]] in [[Vekllei]] and you can furnish a basic standard of living completely out of their stock. You don't pay for their goods but inventory is scanned in and out, mostly by bored teenagers looking to reduce their national service obligation.

It's worth noting that Vekllei tends to be a bit more formal in public than our own world, and this kind of outfit has all the hallmarks of "house clothes" with its clashing colours and bright patterns. 

You wouldn't wear this outside except for sports (not that it stops some people).
