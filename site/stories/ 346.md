Officer in the Army of the Atlantic Crown.
{{</note>}}

Some officers in the Army of the Atlantic Crown wear a tie with their jumpsuit. This is a choice that dates back to WW2, but also a symptom of the visible humanitarian role that the army plays in Vekllei and Africa.

General infantrymen still wear conventional fatigues.

> Yes, the Commonwealth Army is formally known as the Army of the Atlantic Crown. This convention gets applied to recent branches too, like the Rocket Navy of the Atlantic Crown.
