**The sky was heavy with grey and water**, and it bled into the air. Vekllei’s moon months were here, and with it came the end of Vekllei’s bright summer season. In came the days of coats, mist and darkness.

Tzipora here wears *rouisha*, loose-fitting felt pants that have been worn in Vekllei for a thousand years. They’re often worn under a skirt, but can be worn alone as trousers if you like. Today they’re elasticated around the ankles to insulate your legs. She also wears the ‘student cape,’ which is well-known overseas and often held aloft by foreigners as an example of Vekllei’s cultural sophistication. It is not nearly as special in Vekllei.

A single uniform in Vekllei often includes a variety of colours and styles, since its use is [social rather than conformist](https://millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/). Tzipora demonstrates that well here, in her unfortunate collision of school gold, navy, red, and white.

When the air is mild and the wind is still, the mist feels good. It felt good to be in it. Sometimes it’s just good to be alive.
