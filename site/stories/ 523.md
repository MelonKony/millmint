Marsha is taking requests.
{{</note>}}

The only way to get cool, rare clothes in Vekllei is to ask someone to bring you back some from holiday. Marsha's taking requests.

It's a big deal for high schoolers because other islands in the country have fabrics and styles that they don't get up north.

It's a running joke that a girl goes on holiday, and the week after she returns her class is shivering in linens made for the Caribbean.
