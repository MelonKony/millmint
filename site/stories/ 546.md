Baron is Tzipora's adoptive father. She knew him as a [[Noshem]] intelligence agent but she knew he had been a soldier with the [[territorial|Territorial Services]] before that.

He didn't hide his service but he didn't talk about it either. He was a very moderate person.

**The Bread and Sword**

The "bread and sword" indicates a volunteer. It comes from Vekllei politics and their weird transnational regime-pilled anarchism "delivering justice by bread or sword"

It's also a symbol more generally for Vekllei's [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]].
