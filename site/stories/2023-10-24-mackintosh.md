Commonwealth islands get a lot of rain, and raincoats are issued by the Ministry of Education. They vary slightly by region, but in [[Oslola]] they look like this.

Girls get plastic hoods that snap onto their wool capes, which also have a rayon overslip for weatherproofing.

Boys generally get a hoodless mackintosh-style raincoat and an umbrella. The girls need to keep their hair dry, the reasoning goes -- such is the wisdom of the education ministry.
