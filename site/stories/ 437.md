{{<note caption>}}
Tzipora sleeps in her clothes like 50% of the time, because she reads until she passes out.
{{</note>}}

Tzipora is a voracious reader. She likes sci-fi and fantasy best, as well as detective and adventure stories. She reads them in library paperbacks on loan or in enthusiast magazines that publish short stories.

Her favourite book is not science fiction or fantasy -- it's a novella called *Caribbean Holiday*, about twins going to a boarding school in Lucia (Vekllei). It's a kind of comfort reading, cosy and pleasant.
