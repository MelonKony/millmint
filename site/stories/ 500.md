Federal Commonwealth servicemen provide security for nuclear plants and laboratories throughout [[Vekllei]].

Their priority is defending ageing civilian fission reactors, which are much more likely to be targeted by adversaries than the newer fusion reactors in [[Oslola]] and [[Kairi]].

They are part of the [[armed-forces|Armed Forces]] but operate as a paramilitary security police under the [[Ministry of Light and Water]].
