You're not in Rhodesia anymore, son. Welcome to Zaire.

The Korean man who lead 4th Patrol of the volunteer battalion had a reputation for violence. On Friday they watched a half dozen corpses float downstream, their bellies surfacing like porpoises. He took his boys up to Simon Town and found six Rhodies. They shot and buried six Rhodies.

He was a real transnational anarchist. His men often felt strongly about the politics in Zaire, but the Korean couldn't have cared less. The politics of genocide meant nothing to him.

He was a modern fanatic. He was also too good at killing to keep him off patrol.
