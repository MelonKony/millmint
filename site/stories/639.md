The [[armed-forces|Commonwealth Navy]] calls it a survey airship, but it's openly acknowledged that the [[horus-class|Cold Watch]] was designed to detect ballistic missiles. It casts a gaze over most of the Atlantic.

Hot air from its reactor is used for altitude. Hydrogen provides static buoyancy.
