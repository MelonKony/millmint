[[Tzipora]] is Colombian, [[Cobian]] is Inuit. This represents a good opportunity to advance Colombian-Inuit relations.

Many Inuits were forcibly relocated north by the historic [[US|American]] government. Inuits, which Vekllei people call "Algics" through a historic misnomer, make up about half of northern Vekllei people (mostly in the [[volcanic|Volcanic Commonwealth]]).

Tzipora is ethnically Gitana (Spanish Roma) and Yiddish, but was born in Colombia and basically identifies as Colombian.

In public, [[Vekllei]] people speak English, since there are dozens of languages in use around the country. She speaks English with a Latin American accent.
