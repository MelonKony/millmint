"The puffin flies here so early (over the years). The further inland we go, the farther they chase us."

That's the sentiment of the phrase, but in Vekllei 'The puffin flies here' is supplemented with the opening of a saying, 'all birds flee the sea in Winter,' and so there is a reference here that is otherwise lost in translation.
