Soldier from {{<link/habacoa>}} in home patrol kit.
{{</note>}}

Vekllei spans from pole to pole. At the equator, the federalised army wears lighter kit on home patrol.

This uniform is worn at home; around base and around town. They have regular fatigues for training and fighting; this kit is for activities that involve a walking around town.

This soldier is from the republic of {{<link/habacoa>}}. All {{<link/vekllei>}} servicemen are simultaneously a part of a local component (kind of like a national guard) and a federal unit -- in this case the 2nd Habacoan component in the 14th federal regiment.
