This is it. The dates are laid out. I've created a document that tracks the story thus far. Longtime followers might be surprised by where certain events land.

This post will be pinned and serve as a stopgap until I can complete something more professional on my site.

For your convenience, I've embedded links to the relevant posts in each year to help you keep track of the spiralling canon. Please note that this is not a complete or comprehensive catalogue of events, since for the sake of storytelling (and spoilers) I've deliberately excluded the bulk of events around the world in the document above.

This post will be updated with the most current version of the timeline.
