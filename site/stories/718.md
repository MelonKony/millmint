Naval Constables are the Commonwealth version of military police. Like everything in Vekllei it's confusing and unconventional. They have a [[Police]] commission.

The Industrial Detachment secures nuclear infrastructure as soldiers but with the commission of police officers. In Vekllei they can be both soldiers and police at the same time on different commissions.
