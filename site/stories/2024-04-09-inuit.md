Cobian (pronounced Koh-bai-an, not Cobain) is Tzipora's closest girl/friend. When they first met she was a bit tedious and insecure, but she's since become very important to Tzipora.

Her family are indigenous to [[Oslola]] (Iceland), and have lineage going back a thousand years.

She's wearing a 'gi', a ceremonial pleat that sits over the skirt stitched with protective runes, unique to Oslola. Vekllei uniforms are very similar across all its constituent republics, but they have a lot of distinct cultural items like this.
