{{<note caption>}}
At eight years old, the Hera is among the newest aircraft in the Commonwealth Airways fleet.

The Comen *Hera* 55 is the world's smallest supersonic passenger aircraft, and the first of its size to include a swing wing. Passengers love its skylights.

You can only fly them with {{<link/air>}}, the flag carrier of Vekllei and a vital link between its 71 [island republics](/republics/).

**Design Notes**

This jet flies primarily between islands in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, and it really needs low-speed flight manoeuvrability to properly land on runways that aren't as long as those designed for larger, delta-wing international jets. To allow for both supersonic cruising and low-speed take-offs and landings, this design features a swing wing, and it changes angle mid-flight.
