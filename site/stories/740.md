I think [[Vekllei]] would be a pipe-smoking country. You have close proximity to the great tobacco-producing regions of the world, and pipe tobacco can be infused with all sorts of flavours and tastes (Vekllei vape?) It would also be acceptable indoors (unlike cigs).

The rest of the world would smoke pipes too, but they'd be much more common (and so a national symbol) in the Commonwealth. Just had a great idea -- pipes are traditionally a very masculine instrument. What about pipes *for her*?
