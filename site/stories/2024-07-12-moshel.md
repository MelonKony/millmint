A map of Tzipora's alma mater, [Moshel Street](/moshel/).
{{</note>}}

It's pretty new, built in 2044 next to a park with geothermal springs. Because it gets cold and dark in winter, the entire complex can be accessed as a contiguous structure.

In summer, {{<link/tzipora>}} spends her time by the creek among the drumlins.

Most government schools in Vekllei are secular but some retain "chapels" for communal 'pastoral activities' like memorials, praying for sick students, etc. They're nondenominational, but serve as a kind of agnostic spiritual heart of a campus.

The style of the school is usually called volcanic moderne, and is most common in {{<link/oslola>}}. It takes a lot of inspiration from Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin and Maya-inspired homes.
