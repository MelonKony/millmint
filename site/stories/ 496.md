Scouts learning to shoot feat. Kefra, from the excellent [@choitukaee](https://x.com/choitukaee)

It's not unusual for [[Vekllei]] scouts to learn to shoot. They learn for combat, not for sport, and often practice shooting standing and with irons.

Not all scouts learn to shoot, just as not all conscripts go and fight.

Instead, casual familiarity with firearms bolsters a general confidence in their independence from Europe and the Americas, and indicates the principles of their free and self-managing localism.
