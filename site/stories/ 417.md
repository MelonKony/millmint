The atomic frigate CV *Montevideo*.
{{</note>}}

[<span class="fi fi-com"></span> Commonwealth](/vekllei/) atomic frigates are warships designed to operate independently between its islands and archipelagos. To this end, they're equipped for confrontation with pirates, smugglers, and stray fishing vessels encroaching on Vekllei's precious fishing zones.

The Aurora-class has a huge internal magazine stocked with missiles that can kill submarines and satellites, all coordinated by its central fire computer. Frigates are also designed to be replenished at sea via helijet, with rail-mounted missile racks.

Vekllei consists only of island republics, and so its navy is its primary means of defence â€” especially since the country spans the length of the Atlantic and Caribbean. Frigates are the everyday workhorse of its fleet.
