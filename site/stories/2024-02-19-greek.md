Tzipora was [previously learning about the Romans](/stories/library-terminal/).
{{</note>}}

Tzipora is learning about the Greeks now.

She's disillusioned with Roman mythology, so she's going to the source. She learns about the Greeks from library terminals after school, so she can share the best facts over dinner.

{{<link/vekllei>}} actually borrows a lot from Greek myths and iconography, because it is a deeply multicultural society that tries not to favour any single group.

Consequently, at a national level they employ a lot of abstract and placeless civic culture, including their [national dress](/stories/national-dress/).
