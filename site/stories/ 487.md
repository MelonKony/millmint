The Nuclear Ship 'Automan' moves freight at speed across oceans.
{{</note>}}

Rather than containers, ships like the N.S. *Automan* carry modular, palletised railcars that simply roll on and off. These nuclear cargo ships are very fast, and common throughout the Vekllei Lesser Antilles. They facilitate rapid industrial freight, since cargo never leaves the railcar it departed on.

I'll be doing a post on their palletised freight system soon. It's very modular, and quite different to the containerisation with which we're familiar.
