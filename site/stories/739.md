That flag serves a real purpose. The moon is a mess of overlapping claims and so "exclusion zones" make up the enforced, physical borders. Vekllei has a particle accelerator on the moon to create magnetic [[monopoles]], so they patrol huge areas around it to keep people out. Monopolar particle accelerators have been sabotaged in the past (famously in Siberia in 2031) so they've got a total exclusion zone in place.

> The hood and plate poncho are to stop random rocks from killing you and the flag pole is to stop it getting twisted in zero atmosphere. I just reinvented the samurai by mistake
