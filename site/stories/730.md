Frontier border patrol officers are just regular [[police]] with a "frontier commission," so they're basically part time. 

If you're bored at the station why not apply for the "equatorial ranger programme" at the [[Commonwealth Police College]]? Then you can camp out on uninhabited Caribbean islands.
