Hello,

**I’m Hobart,** and I’m the creator of this place. I’ve been drawing Vekllei for a few years now, and I love doing it.

To celebrate 3,000 members, **use this as a cosy thread/AMA to settle in,** and have any questions you might have about the project answered.

For those who are new, **I encourage you to read the posts pinned to the top of the subreddit** for a crash course in what’s going on here.

For longtime friends, come say hi! **This is a party thread, whoo!**

**Quik Fax:**

* **Vekllei** is a country set in what we know as **Iceland**, in an alternate vision of the future.
* It’s my **utopia**, which means it’s an expression of everything I value in life, the good and the bad.
* I draw all sorts of things, and write about all sorts of topics — all set in Vekllei or other countries. It’s slowly becoming a comprehensive utopia, filling in everything from [economics](https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/) to [love stories](https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-23-love/) to [metaphysics](https://millmint.net/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/) and [espionage](https://millmint.net/posts/2019-11-16-coup/). You’ll notice the scope shift a lot in my posts.
* The project has a **comic** being worked on, available to my [patrons](https://www.patreon.com/vekllei) as an ongoing series of drafts at the moment. Otherwise, “**Vekllei**” is what you see here — a collection of **posts** that are snapshots of the world. It doesn’t have an end goal, it’s just what I like to do.
* **Every post I have ever made**, plus an expanding collection of **wiki articles** about this project, can be found at my website: [millmint.net](http://millmint.net/)

Thank you sincerely for paying attention and caring for my work. It’s a wonderful thing we’ve got going here.

Kind regards,

**Hobart**/MelonKony
