A Commonwealth Littoral Service *[Wake-class](/wake-class)* "Patrol Motor Launch."
{{</note>}}

These boats and the handful of (or even solitary) officers that crew them are the floating police stations of Vekllei archipelagos. They are also the home of the littoral service commanding officer.

Although they conduct policing and rescue operations, a lot of what they do is just patrolling and conversation. They often carry post or messages between islands, and serve a generalised role in their communities. They have a lot of freedom in how they go about their activities, and are left alone by the Littoral Service as long as the work gets done.
