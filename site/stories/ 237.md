**Caught amidst sunrays in early Autumn, things are good**. You could call almost anyone on the telephone these days. And if you wanted to see someone, why travel? A videophone was just as good. But just as the photograph failed to displace the painter, neither did the telephone or videophone succeed in killing the hand-written letter. There was something thoughtful about it. It was intimate, but also dependent on memory. Memories of people, memories of places. It was slower, yes, but that's just how life worked in this country. It is a good way to live.
