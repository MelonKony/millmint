All [[Police]] in [[Vekllei]] go through the same [[commonwealth-police-college|college]] and pick up a basic commission. From there, they acquire "endorsements" in specialisations. A constable might serve as a parish officer on Monday, detective on Wednesday, and sea marshal over the weekend.

For a country full of federalised organisations, the police are unusually unitary. Yet they suit the character of the country, participating in a number of roles simultaneously.
