On the advice of her colleagues at [[Common Gemstone]], Rin took her two months annual leave in [[Summers]] to work on her Great Commonwealth Novel.

She returned with just fifteen pages and sunburn, saying "it's too hot to think there."

Rin doesn't swim. She stayed at an inn at Magic Head and spent most of her time smoking on the balcony listening to records, or walking in well-shaded woods.

She put on weight eating so much, but sweat most of it off doing odd jobs around the inn for the owner.
