The Commonwealth National Economic Register is basically a giant computer that prices goods in a social economy. That's important, because they indicate demand. You can read about the moneyless economy, and the formulae that determine these signals in my new article, [[commons|The Vekllei Commons]].

Vekllei's social economy is very pure idea: people do not use money in everyday life. Like most pure ideas, it's actually very complicated, and so they have a sophisticated constellation of markets, incentives, heavy industry, automation and culture that facilitates it.

It helps, of course, that they live on islands with good food, beautiful men and women, wine, spices and myrrh. Far from abolishing the Olds, moneylessness has actually intensified them. They adore [[courtesy|etiquette, titles, good manners, gifts and privileges]].
