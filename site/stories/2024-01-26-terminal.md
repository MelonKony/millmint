Going to the moon is a big deal and you dress up for it.
{{</note>}}

Travel to the moon is a whole process â€” you have to fly to the [astroport](/astroport/) on [[Ascension]], attend the flight briefing and have a medical checkup. Eventually, Tzipora and Baron are on [[starlines|Commonwealth Starlines]] Flight 1 to the moon.

Although the timing coincided with Tzipora's birthday, you can't time a trip to the moon. There are only about sixty slots a day and there's a two-year wait.

With some patience and luck, however, any Vekllei citizen can visit space, a special privilege of their society.
