{{</note>}}

These Avia Sunjets are manufactured by {{<link/gaf>}} for {{<link/air>}}. They're perfect for island-hopping routes throughout the Vekllei Caribbean, because their swing-wing design allows them to land on shorter island runways.

They are particularly beloved in {{<link/vekllei>}} for their gorgeous sunroofs that line the roof of the cabin, which are UV-protected and able to change opacity.
