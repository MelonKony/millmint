Most large ships have security teams, but only commandos are trained in boarding, which can involve hair-raising stunts out at sea. In combat they always wear anti-flash gear, nicknamed "white hoods," and carry signature carbines equipped with 100-round helical magazines.

The WVN Noble is the Mercy-class security ship depicted here in the [previous](/stories/common-navy) [[Common Navy]] drawing. It carries an assault group of naval commandos comprising five detachments or about 50 men.
