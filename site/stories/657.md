Mechanisation, computerisation and centralisation has made sure the Department Store remains the primary place of commerce in Vekllei (insofar as commerce exists). The [[atlantic store|Atlantic Department Co.]] is, surprisingly, still privately owned.

It is a perfect example of the bizarre manifestation of their [[ludic productivity|ludic]], moneyless economy -- where things carry on much as they did before in appearance. The base has changed but in many ways the superstructure remains the same. People continue to "shop" without money.
