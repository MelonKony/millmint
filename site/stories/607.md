Moon immigration is set up to be a mirror of earth, with a few caveats. Security is conducted on [[Ascension]], so it's just a matter of paperwork.

It takes a while to acclimatise, but by the time you land on the moon passengers have already been in zero gravity for 12+ hours anyway.

The spacecraft is a [[CM-100]].
