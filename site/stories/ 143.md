I had the wonderful opportunity to work with one of our resident worldbuilders on reddit, u/EpicJM, and spend a while with their world and characters. The world of Eipljord has a lot of distinct, unique cultures and characters. As a sucker for uniforms I went with the garb of the Pruscyldan Academy of Magic, and you'll find JM's character, Honora being splattered with ice cream by Tzipora on the left and in Vekllei education uniform on the right. You can see the Vekllei racing jet from a previous post face off against Pruscyldan BlackJay behind her.

JM's got a very big world and a [very good instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jm_draws_stuff/). I'd recommend checking out both. It's not often I get the chance to work with nice volcanic islands and sandy beaches (nor Tzipora to visit them!) so thanks u/EpicJM for working with me.
