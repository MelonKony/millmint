This is the "Mad Dog," a *[[Swordfish-class]]* Air Escort Destroyer.

Their Rackham surface-to-air missile systems are outrageously large because they have to have the option to carry a nuclear warhead. Their missiles are also controlled by a master computer, and are essentially radio-guided because of the limitations of their [[computers|optical computer systems]].
