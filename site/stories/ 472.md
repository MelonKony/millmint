Tzipora likes machines, and she especially likes trains. She follows them around to find rare ones.
{{</note>}}

Thanks to her new book, Tzipora has found one of the few remaining steam locomotives still in regular passenger service in Vekllei.

This one has been running for 110 years. She had to take a superconducting maglev to find it. Vekllei has a [social economy](/social-economy/), and so [high and low tech coexists simultaneously](/bulletin/technology/), bucking technocratic logic.
