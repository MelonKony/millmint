Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.

Welcome to the ‘Petticoat Project’, a collection of stories about a country and a girl. The concept is broken down into three sections:

1. **Author:** for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc.
2. **Character:** for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.
3. **Landscape:** for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.

Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.

## The Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest

The core of the Vekllei project is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas. Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.

In this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei  — a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora — a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.

>The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can’t in reality.

Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money  — go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too — but look at her! She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.

Keep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things. A city can be utopian without it being perfect  — a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia  — instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.

## The Author

The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they’ve had  — but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).

## Vekllei [/vƐk.laɪ/]

Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal  — an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.

## Tzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dzɪpˈɔːr.ə’dƐm.wəːn.Ɛːh/]

If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.

This project is sort of what I want to do, and I can’t imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I’ll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei. Thanks for stopping by.

Kind regards,

Hobart Phillips
