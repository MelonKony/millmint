Commonwealth (Vekllei) medals and accoutrement
{{</note>}}

Baron is Tzipora's adoptive father. She knew him as a {{<link/noshem>}} intelligence agent but she knew he had been a soldier with the {{<link/territorial>}} before that.

He didn't hide his service but he didn't talk about it either. He was a very moderate person.

**The Bread and Sword**

The "bread and sword" indicates a volunteer. It comes from Vekllei politics and their weird transnational regime-pilled anarchism "delivering justice by bread or sword"

It's also a symbol more generally for Vekllei's {{<link/armed-forces>}}.
