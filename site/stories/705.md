This is technically a droid, since all its operations are offloaded to a large optical computer called an automatic asset command. They don't have weapons, and usually patrol a small area. Amusingly, they can intervene in an assault by ramming the attacker harmlessly and repeatedly.

Instead, like most mobile robots in Vekllei, they take care of simple and tedious tasks and serve an auxiliary role in the police force. For example, constables can summon them via radio to block a road, use their phones or check for carbon monoxide.

Different equipment boxes can be locked onto a swivelling, circular rail for different purposes. These include things like first aid kits, larger speakers, dazzling lights or even firearms.
