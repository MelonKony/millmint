Hello everyone,

This is 2022, Year of Vekllei.

For the next 100 days I’m going to do something for Vekllei every day. These 'somethings' could be

* Posts you see, exploring Vekllei
* Articles on [the website](https://millmint.net), including upcoming pages on Government and new character pages.
* Inking of comic pages -- leading up to a release soon. It's been a long time coming but it'll be worth it.
* New illustrations for use in merchandise(!)
* Working on new website features or the upcoming MillMint shop

2021 was a pretty bad year. I won’t go on about it much because it’s not very interesting and it’s not the point of my writing this. Let's only hope suffering makes good art!

This last year, I haven't finished what I've wanted to finish, and it's caused some anxiety for me for months now. This is my New Year's resolution to you all, including my [beloved patrons](https://www.patreon.com/vekllei), who I thank sincerely for sticking with me through a really inconsistent creative period.

New Year's resolutions are kind of corny, and they don't work out for everyone. So don't think of this as a resolution as such -- 2022 is a nice even number, and it's a good time, arbitrary as any other, for a change in the winds.

My goal is to have something to show every other day or so. I've got a long list of ideas I'm going to work through. Hopefully this will provoke a change in behaviour from me.

Why not join me? Pick up a pencil and I'll draw with you. You can come say hi at the [Vekllei Discord server](https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU) and catch me drawing sometime.

Thanks again. I'm only at the start of the journey here. But this community is where it begins.

Warm regards,

Hobart/MelonKony
