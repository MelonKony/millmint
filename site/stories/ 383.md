This character belongs to a Japanese artist and train enthusiast I follow on Twitter. Something about her appearance and oversized glasses were really funny to me, so I decided to draw her. This must have been out of left field for him, since I'd never interacted with him before, but he really liked it!

Her name is Sabae-chan, and was created by [@unagiPost](https://twitter.com/unagiPost). "Sabae" is a city in Japan famous for manufacturing, well, glasses.

[@unagiPost](https://twitter.com/unagiPost) liked my drawing:

So I said she was planning to go on vacation:

His followers reacted with amusement that someone from Australia was drawing his characters:

> "Now you're an international cultured person!"

> "This character is more popular with overseas followers than in Japan, so I would like to consider adding English without joking."

> "I have to study English! 'Lady Sabae.'"

It's funny how the internet connects train enthusiasts.
