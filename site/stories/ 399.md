A paint-sketch of a Vekllei civil servant.
{{</note>}}

Vekllei business attire is pretty casual by the standards of its setting. Heels for women are rarely more than an inch, and they wear cotton and wool instead of nylon and rayon. Men sometimes wear sport coats to the office.

Some women in clerical positions can even get away with clean tennis shoes, which is unheard of in Western business culture in Vekllei's world. Suits are still mandatory for meetings and in certain departments, especially in the Foreign Ministry.

She wears the Commonwealth pin on her blouse to show she works for the government. At its centre is a precious stone indicating length of service: ruby for 5 years, sapphire for 10, emerald for 20 and diamond for 25+ years.
