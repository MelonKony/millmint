The industrial production of synthetic meats have made prime cuts widely available. Many urban [[Vekllei]] people have not eaten meat from an animal.

Ironically, this is a problem for people like Tzipora who grew up overseas, eating offal and gristle. It's harder to find.

Vekllei is a society that values skill and the dignity of work, but food is a mechanical, industrial process.   

While community agriculture fills in some gaps, the reality is that they are fed by a mammoth, centrally-planned system of advanced machinery and logistics.
