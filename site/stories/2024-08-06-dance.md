They don't have dates, so they dance with each other.

{{<link/cobian>}}'s 'Algic' (Inuit) dress is like her version of a poodle skirt I guess. I was going for sock-hop look. Vekllei isn't a pastiche of the 50s, but it is crazy how much more people used to dance last century.

Vekllei people love to dance.
