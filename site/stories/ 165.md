Despite appearances, most of the population of Vekllei are Scandinavian, not Asian.

Zhu is the first time in a long time I've drawn an ethnically Chinese person. She was graciously lent to me to draw by u/boodyclap in an art trade. [You can see his end of the deal here](https://imgur.com/a/pm6cuMH), complete with Tzipora balancing a baseball bat.

In Zhu's homeland she suffers a meat-heavy diet, and Vekllei is the first time she's seen a salad this big. You can see iconic Vekllei icebergs washing ashore on a beach of black sand behind them. I'll let u/boodyclap share any extra tidbits below :)

Follow Zhu's adventures at [@the\_jeggy](https://www.instagram.com/the_jeggy/) on insta.

If you like worldbuilding, trains or friendship please come [join us at the Vekllei Discord](https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU). It's a good time.

More posts soon.

Love,

Hobart
