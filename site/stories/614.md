In coordination typical of [[vekllei|Commonwealth]] military procurement, hard points for airlift are built into their main battle tanks. They shuffle them around, obscuring their view from satellites and missiles.

Disseminating military equipment across their hundreds of islands in the Caribbean and Atlantic makes it harder to determine what they've got where, and so makes it harder to plan a naval landing.

They aim to extract blood from every soldier on their beaches.
