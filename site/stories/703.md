The International Lunar Hotel was built for Vekllei people with the promise that each person who wanted to visit the moon could do so once in their lifetime. It has 3,000 rooms and functions as Vekllei's primary lunar settlement.

The flight up takes about 24 hours, and the "lunar ticket" gives you 3 nights. Why not go for an spacewalk at Astro Tower, or visit the lido spa that overlooks Nobile crater? The Lunar Hotel is part of Artemis city, which includes research and defence installations.
