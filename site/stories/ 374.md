Tzipora's only party dress.
{{</note>}}

Tzipora was a foreigner. It was hard to pick out a distinct cultural background amidst her school uniform and wardrobe of modest, secular dailywear, which is typical of Vekllei. But she was a foreigner, and on a few days a year, when she wore her only party dress, you remembered that fact.

It is easy to lose track of who comes from where in Vekllei. About half of people were born overseas, and the other half have history in one of a dozen scattered republics that make up the country. It is a deeply multicultural society, a fact which is treasured and protected by the Commonwealth government.

At school, they wore the same uniforms every day, which made seeing your classmates at the end-of-term formal a shock. People you thought had lived here all their lives showed up in gowns of styles you'd never seen. And here was Tzipora, previously known as an Italian, a Gypsy, an Indian or whatever else they guessed of her, now revealed to be Colombian -- as she always had been.

<!--In general, the centralisation of textiles and clothing manufacturers in Vekllei has had the effect of obscuring ethnicity. The Commonwealth has no common race, language or culture. Instead, it is a country by values and circumstance. This is a market that offers everyone basically the same department stores with the same styles of clothes, whether your family has been here for two weeks or a thousand years. The wardrobes of Vekllei people are filled with modest dailywear and something nice for church or occasions, which has the effect of reifying the appearance of society.

To clarify, when we talk about dressing people 'basically the same,' we do not imply literal uniforms as found in their schools or something comparable to the 'Mao-suit' -- department stores offer a million items in many styles. But they are all *commonwealth* styles, in a vision of the *democratic* man and woman, and so they do not contribute to the diverse cultural clothing background of Vekllei's disparate republics. That is not to say that traditional or cultural clothing does not exist (it is common) or that it is suppressed (it isn't) -- just that this state of affairs is convenient for a new country eager to celebrate a shared, civic identity in which any man filled with the democratic spirit can gain citizenship.-->
