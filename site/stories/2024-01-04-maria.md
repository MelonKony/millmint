Tzipora isn't on speaking terms with the Big Man upstairs, but she loves Maria.
{{</note>}}

Tzipora has a weird Catholic theology where she's fallen out with God like a roommate and now only communicates with him through saints.

Her neighbourhood is mostly Jewish, and her friend Cobian is animistic in the [[Oslola]] (Icelandic) tradition. Vekllei is a melting pot.

Ayn is part thai and was raised buddhist, Moise is Greek Orthodox, Lin Zhi is a militant atheist (born in the wrong timeline for reddit).
