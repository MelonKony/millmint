{{< question id="bucolic">}}
Is urban life somewhat bucolic, by way of Vekllei's culture?
{{< /question >}}

{{< answer >}}
To an extent, I think so. There's a few major differences.

1. The density of their society has no parallel in the Western hemisphere. I don't mean tower blocks; they have relatively few tower blocks. But every inch of space is used, there's very little empty space in cities. There's a hard divide between human/nature in most places. By this I mean streets are rarely full-sized roads; they're branch paths off a road, and the streets are lined with houses and gardens. Rooftop gardens are common. So the scale of their lives is somewhat smaller, spatially -- their communities are scaled way down.

2. they practice small agriculture. Staples are produced en masse by industry, but specialties are almost always locally grown. This includes herbs, special types of tomatoes, that sort of thing. Almost everything has a garden, so heavy gardening/light farming is practiced almost universally, even in apartments.

3. their pace of life is slower. I think that's an underrated motivation in their work culture -- it's something to do. Even cities are quiet, at least in residential areas.

I think that would contribute to what foreign urban dwellers could describe as bucolic, but they're also a very urbanised country and comparatively few people actually live in rural or pastoral surrounds.
