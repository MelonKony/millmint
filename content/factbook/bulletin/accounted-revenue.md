**Summary**

* Vekllei businesses that operate in [domestic markets](/factbook/society/state/finance/#domestic-markets) do not generally use money.
* This includes government corporations and departments.
* Despite this, Vekllei maintains a kind of commercial accounting that produces accurate, if fictional, revenues, expenditures and profit/loss metrics.
* This is known as "accounted revenue," and is a shorthand for normal money-use on this site, but refers only to calculated theoretical values.

Although {{<link/vekllei>}} does not use money in domestic markets, it has a very sophisticated system of interlinked databases to monitor and record the economy. Physical product has a tangible presence and consequently a tangible cost, even if it not assigned a money-value. As such, Vekllei simply calculates the money-value of everything in its society, from homes to wages to toothbrushes, and uses those figures as a means to determine the health of its economy.

How they arrive at these figures is complicated and detached from real-world money-value. The "accounted value" figure, as it is called, is a combination of labour-hours at a wage calculation, exchange rates, comparative pricing in major international currencies, and scarcity. To this end, the Commonwealth uses commercial accounting practices to target waste and maintain the *commons* moneyless system.

"Accounted value," or more specifically, "accounted revenue" is also used as a means of budgeting, especially for government departments. So even though Vekllei at face value appears to suppress ordinary money-value and by extension financialised markets, it is in fact deeply financialised and is closely monitored and controlled by the [Ministries of Commerce](/ministry-of-commerce/).
