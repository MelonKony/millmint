The {{<link/vekllei>}} economy is the only economy of its size to employ effective moneylessness.[^moneylessness] This idea seems to break basic the premise of markets and economic theory, but this is not really true. Beneath opaque language, a complex federal system, complex social economics and a multilayered financial system, Vekllei economic principles are identifiable, traceable and sober. In its sum, Vekllei represents a reformed rather than revolutionary market.

## Summary

Vekllei has no official or recognised economic regime, but has provisions for its *commons* system in its constitution. In practice, Vekllei economists are open about their assumptions of economy and what provides positive outcomes for Vekllei markets.

1. There is no invisible hand of the market, and an unfettered market does not necessarily produce efficient or positive outcomes.
2. Conversely, markets are a natural product of independence and self-interest common among all people.
3. Legal regulation is important, but social norms and acceptable corporate governance is just as critical.
4. Land is the fundamental economic unit from which planning
5. Trade surpluses can erode prosperity when they run detrimental deficits in neighbours.
6. The economy serves competent governance and not the other way around, and will recover under that confidence.
7. There are desirable government interventions that can improve market efficiency.
