Territories, dependencies and autonomous regions are administrative areas of the Commonwealth that are not considered [Constituent](/constituents/) members. This is usually because they lack a large permanent population able to form its own [Assembly](/assembly/), or otherwise form part of a special administrative territory that has been federalised.

As non-constituents, they are unable to form Sords and have permanent observer status in the [Commownealth Council](/council/). These territories include:

**Vekllei Federal Territories**

* Vekllei Antarctic Territories
* Vekllei Lunar Territories

**Dependent States**

* Aismious Islands (*Faroe Islands*)
* Demon Islands (*Jan Mayen*)
* Helvasia (*Svalbard*)
* Sude Islands (*South Georgia & Sandwich Islands*)
* Falklands Islands (*Falklands Islands*)
* Santes (*St Helena*)
* Ascension (*Ascension Islands*)
* Tristan (*Tristan de Cunha*)
* Bermuda (*Bermuda*)
