## Overview

The Commonwealth Bank (also *Bank of Vekllei*) is the central bank and currency store of [<span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei](/vekllei/). It is operated by the [Ministry of Commerce](/cosmosol/) and maintains branches in all Vekllei republics and in many countries around the world. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of Ministry of Commerce and, in certain cases, the republic and commonwealth parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for encourage growth and benefit Vekllei people.

The Commonwealth Bank was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in [Lola](/lola/), and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.

Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:

* Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.
* Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.
* International placement and borrowing services.
* Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.

Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.

Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.
