The *Commonwealth Military Command* (CMC) is the unifying command organisation for the {{<link/military>}}, responsible ultimately for facilitating Commonwealth control of the armed forces. While [republics](/republics/) retain direct command over the armed forces, defence activities are in practice federalised by default under Commonwealth control, and so the CMC is the primary military command in {{<link/vekllei>}}. In principle, the CMC accommodates open communication between the Armed Forces and the Commonwealth, but more commonly acts as a *de facto* command organisation for broad military arrangements outside of direct military administration like defence policy, strategic planning, military infrastructure and logistics, and communications.

Commonwealth member-states usually maintain their own [defence ministries](/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/), and the CMC aims to standardise and consolidate defensive strength across the Commonwealth. It is made up of the following departments.

* **General Council**: CMC administration and parliament liaison.
* **Department of War**: All war-related strategic planning and activities, including preparation for operations.
* **Department of Peacekeeping**: All activities related to Vekllei peacekeeping and expeditionary operations.
* **Department of Training & Mobilisation**: Standardisation of training and mobilisation of troops across the Commonwealth.
* **Department of Communications**: Coordination between the parliaments and the Palace, as well as public information.
