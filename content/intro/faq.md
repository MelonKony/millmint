## Quick Facts

* **Vekllei is a utopia**, but that doesn't mean I don't take it seriously or consider its society pragmatically.
* **It's full of stuff I love**, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Personal growth can come from bad experiences.
* **I draw in certain styles**, but Vekllei isn't based off any one country.
* **Vekllei is mostly self-contained stories**, but I experiment with mediums and methods all the time.

## F.A.Q.

#### Who are you?

[A Tasmanian illustrator.](/news/about/)

#### You’re not Japanese?

お前はもう死んでいる

#### Why is Vekllei a utopia?

It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.

#### It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?

Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.

#### Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?

Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.

#### Is there a novel? A story? A comic?

I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.

#### Where is Vekllei?

Iceland.

#### Why does Vekllei look Japanese?

Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.

#### How does that make sense?

Why can’t it just be cool?

#### Is your alt-history thought out?

Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.

#### Why does Vekllei call itself “petticoat socialist”?

Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy. It's almost anarchic in that sense.

#### Why the "petticoat"?

Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It's maternal, social and friendly where progressive utopian rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and historicist.

#### Who is Zelda?

Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.

## Futher Reading

If you're curious what sort of things go into a place like Vekllei, these are some of my favourite books. I've been asked about them before, so I've included this section in the hopes you enjoy them as much as I have. There are many more than these, so if you're interested, [contact me](/news/about). I'll update this list periodically as more occur to me.

### On the Origins of Modern Japanese Literature
**Karatani Kojin** | 1993

Karatani interrogates the appearance of Western conceptual artefacts (Landscape, The Child, Interiority) during the Meiji period in Japan. This book had a tremendous impact on my assumptions about the world and affected Vekllei tremendously.

### Starting Point *&* Turning Point
**Miyazaki Hayao** | 2009 & 2014

These books are essentially a compilation of essays from Miyazaki's years as a filmmaker. He's an incredibly smart and insightful creative force whose work [I have written at length about](/news/essays/ghibli) before. For me, it's all really powerful, affecting stuff.

### Three Faces of Utopianism Revisited
**Lyman Sargent** | 1994

This is the defining taxonomical look at the phenomena of utopianism and how it works. His breakdown of 'utopia' into both dystopian and eutopian elements is also my preffered descriptor and use of 'utopia' as a concept.

### Towards a New Architecture
**Le Corbusier** | 1936

Vekllei is a postmodern mess, but also deeply sympathetic to the modernist instinct. I like the utopianism of the 20th Century, and Le Corbusier typifies that 'utopian' futurism we saw in that period. I like how single-minded he is about it. His buildings remain beautiful, many years on.
