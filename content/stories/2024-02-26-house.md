Cobian's house is a hundred years old, and built in the *Volcanic Moderne* style out of precast concrete bricks. It's much bigger and nicer than [Tzipora's apartment](/stories/apartment-diagram/).

**Note**

I wanted something modernist but appropriate to their climate which is tricky since modernists love flat roofs.

It's actually similar to the prairie style done by Frank Lloyd Wright, in particular his mayan inspired homes

I think that style works well in {{<link/oslola>}} because it's very solid and monumental, which reflects their landscape well. There's a lot of details in masonry and murals etc too
