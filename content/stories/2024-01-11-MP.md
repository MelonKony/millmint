She hasn't done anything wrong but it sure FEELS like she has.

The territorial service of Vekllei is a federal army, and comprises servicemen from 71 city-states in the Atlantic. Unlike the U.S. National Guard, these regiments are federalised by default. Even professional, volunteer servicemen in the commandos are federalised troops.

Even more confusingly, Vekllei has "services" in place of seperate branches, descended from the navy. So a territorial serviceman can be a subnational militiaman, federal soldier, and commando infantryman simultaneously, since service is simply "enhanced" rather than superseded.
