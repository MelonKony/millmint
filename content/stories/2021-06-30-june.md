**Thanks for a great June**. We've had a lot of different types of posts this month. About 15 in all — that's one every two days! Not bad! I could do with some sleep.

Something very special is approaching in July. I'm very excited to share it with you all — so are Tzipora and Cobian. A new chapter in Vekllei is fast approaching.

See you soon.

Much love,
