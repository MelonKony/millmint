Tzipora wants to be a conformist but she's too much of a weirdo.
{{</note>}}

Tzipora's smoking habit upsets Cobian because she's a square, but Tzipora is a nonconformist by nature, not by choice.

She keeps some smokes in her [purse](/stories/purse/) because it's good for the nerves. It was a bad habit she picked up in America working at Hotel Zion.
