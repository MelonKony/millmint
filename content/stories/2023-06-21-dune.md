{{<link/oslola>}} has a number of highland dunes made of fine black sand, formed by its active volcanoes and shaped by glacial runoff.

A popular game when visiting is to race someone to the bottom. Because these dunes are very steep and very tall (up to 40 meters) it's easy to end up flying down face-first.

The dunes also have a very important role in Oslolan mythology, as the birthplace of subterranean mole creatures called Somoron.
