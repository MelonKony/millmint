College girls from {{<link/allia>}}, part of {{<link/vekllei>}}.
{{</note>}}

They speak Irish and an {{<link/allia>}} creole, and are descended from Irish and African peoples mostly compelled there by the British. They take a super-hydrofoil to Antam (Antigua) for their classes.

Vekllei people wear the same uniforms from preschool right through university, but they vary at the tertiary level depending on their field of study. Law students conventionally wear suits; scientists wear coats. Humanities, mathematics and other deskbound types wear the same styles they did in high school.

Their uniforms are assembled off the rack from department stores. While all of Vekllei uses navy and white, cultural items vary their appearance dramatically and there are no restrictions on hair or jewellery.
