Let's call it "convergent evolution..."
{{</hint>}}

The Casemate fighter is the latest atomic fighter in Commonwealth service. It continues the tradition of straightforward fighter aircraft with excellent flight characteristics in the Atlantic.

The ongoing evolution of the nuclear fighter is obvious compared to its predecessor [here](/stories/fighter/), which has its reactor mounted beneath the reactor for easy servicing.

**Notes on Safety**
<br>
A century of miniaturisation of fission has improved safety in vehicles but it's still not perfect. The aircraft has gyroscopes to auto-scramble the reactor and the reactor system is well-shielded.

Nonetheless, Vekllei's greatest safety measure is that it is a country of islands, and its aircraft are most often flown over water.
