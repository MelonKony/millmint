Commonwealth islands get a lot of rain, and raincoats are issued by the Ministry of Education. They vary slightly by region, but in Oslola they look like this.

Girls get plastic hoods that snap onto their wool capes, which also have a rayon overslip for weatherproofing.

Boys generally get a hoodless mackintosh-style raincoat and an umbrella. The girls need to keep their hair dry, the reasoning goes -- such is the wisdom of the education ministry.
