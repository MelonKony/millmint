**Fruit Tingles** (*Fodsa Spas*) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They're as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.

They're exported and enjoyed all over the commonwealth, from Kala to Kalina.

Clockwise: **Hen**, from Kus (Kala), **Bez**, from Demon, **Tzipora**, from Seispri (Vekllei) and **Sydney**, from Montesur (Kalina).
