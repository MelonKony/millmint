[Veletia](/veletia/) is the personification of the Vekllei Commonwealth and its democracy. She can appear alone or simultaneously as one of Six Sisters, identical in appearance but reflecting the ethnic background of the six main cultural and ethnic groups of Vekllei.

## A Place for All People

The Vekllei Commonwealth[^vekllei] is explicitly multiracial; it is a fact of design and circumstance. It was announced in the preamble of the [Vekllei Constitution](/constitution/):

{{<note panel>}}
THE PUBLIC OF THE OCEANS ATLANTIC RESOLVES
* to bring peace to Commonwealth realms twice destroyed in the pursuit of war, and
* to establish a new way of living worthy of a commitment in peace, and
* to protect the equal rights of men and women, and the dignity and worth of the human person, and
* to provide for the material and spiritual needs necessary in the aim of a commitment to dignity,

AND IN SERVICE OF THESE AIMS
* to unite the languages, culture, and races of the Public under a democratic and prosperous society, and
* to defend these values unwaveringly by all means available to its councils, and
* to elevate the lives of Atlantic people through a gracious and good Fourth Commonwealth
{{</note>}}

Commonwealth people (called *Vekllei nationals* interchangeably) have a sovereign known as the Crown. The Crown is not a person, but a metaphysical presence of their lands and seas. In modern practice, the Crown is a collective belief in a sort of soft anarchism; a Commonwealth way of living, with new and thoughtful methods of democracy and society. Chief among these is a sort of internationalism distinct from communists and postwar futurists alike. In this way, the Crown is distinguished from scientific ideology the likes of which pervaded the 20th Centuries; their anarchism is a kind of secular faith bound up in a deep appreciation of space and neighbour.

You can see this in extraordinary aspects of Commonwealth society, like its constructed written language, Veletian (named for [Veletia](/veletia/), the personification of Floral Democracy). Similarly, "Vekllei nationality" refers not merely to any one culture or race of people, but a constructed person, with national characteristics based on ideology rather than geography.

A lot of the interventions the Vekllei government makes in the lives of individuals are concessions to the reality of this 'international' Commonwealth. It is a country of distant constituent republics with no common race or culture. To Floral ideology, this situation is not merely an obstacle, or unnatural, but in fact aspirational --  to unite distant people around common values, to raise the standard of living blindly, and to vigilantly impress upon the world its explicit values as a country -- democracy, multiracialism and the worth of the individual.

In a world that is shrinking once again, these values resonate with many people around the world. Many immigrants after the war were not just looking for better lives but to participate in the building of a new society. And these values are diligently enforced in all aspects of society, from education to housing and employment. Even with constituional provisions for free speech and association, Vekllei is a country with institutional opinions about good and bad ideas, and will curtail organising around threats to its way of living.

## The People of the Commonwealth

The Commonwealth is a multiracial country including almost all oceanic and islander peoples of the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans. In its north, in {{<link/oslola>}} and Kala, **Algic (Inuit)** and **Norse-Scandinavian** descended residents have authentic indigenous claims to the land. In the Kalina Isles, on the West Antilles, the indigenous people are **Kalinago**.

## A Commonwealth Identity

In Oslola, where Tzipora and most of her friends live, the differences in heritage emerge in novel and interesting ways. Cobian comes from a long line of Algic people, and has lived her whole life in Oslolan seasons. Tzipora observed Cobian wore skirts deep into winter, where Tzipora switches to underskirt pants by October at the latest.

[^vekllei]: "Vekllei" is an Algic short poem meaning people of the sea, people of the stars, employed and recontextualised by the current Commonwealth as a sort of pan-Atlantic nationality.
