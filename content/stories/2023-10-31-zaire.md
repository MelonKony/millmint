The 1st Volunteers Regiment became among the most decorated in Vekllei history for their bravery and sacrifice in Zaire.

After 140 days of brutal combat marked by mud, hand-to-hand fighting, infiltrators, scavenging, mortar-fire, terror, and unparalleled bravery, they were home.

Coretti, a rifleman of the 1st, is wearing Barracks Dress, which is between day fatigues and formal dress in formality.

She wears a gi (a ceremonial Oslolan pleat), her sabre (all infantry are trained swordsmen), service revolver, and her awards, including her Medal of Valour.
