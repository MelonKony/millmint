Tzipora stood astride the bicycle luggage rack, and looked at her best friend Moise. She smiled at him, and looked to the town before them, and squinted at the clouds rising over the Atlantic horizon.

It was a warm late summer and there was salt in the air. Pebbles made better swimmers than Tzipora, but from up here she could admire the coast and fill her heart with the breeze.

She looked at the road ahead, and thought about what they’d eat for tea. It was all good from here.

She had a thought that she would remember this moment for the rest of her life.
