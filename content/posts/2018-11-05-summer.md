In Down Under it's coming around summer, and things are heating up. It's not my fault Yanks broke the northern hemisphere and made the weather go wrong.

Vekllei gets warm in the summer, reaching heights of 30C occasionally. [For a variety of reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/90f56z/hot_summer_rain_on_a_beach_of_black_sand_iceland/). A city of gardens and flowerbeds (the most flowers per capita in the world, actually), apartment dwellers take turns watering their local gardens and clearing weeds. Most parks have utility as herb or fruit gardens, and so maintenance of those plants in summer is important.

And to all the new folks following me, cheers! I post to my profile every so often, usually snapshots of domestic life or Tzipora that I can't crowbar into a r/worldbuilding format. Posting to that sub affects what kind of content you make, and I like making lots of different types of content, so a lot of different things end up here.

Thanks everyone
