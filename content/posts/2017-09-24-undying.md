Tzipora is a [Gregori baby, a child who doesn’t age](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6xtflc/tzipora_one_of_the_children_to_stop_ageing_vekllei/) and cannot contract cell-mutating diseases. She is the adopted daughter of Michael Desmoines, an espionage quartermaster for a foreign power in the United States.

She is clever, sensitive, and deeply humanist. Despite her shyness and her loneliness, she is remembered by the few whose lives she touched as an affectionate and exceptionally gifted girl.

She has a chronic sadness about her. She feels distinct and separated from the human race, a feeling exacerbated by her Gregori syndrome and a mild obsessive-compulsiveness that makes her feel like a freak. She turns her emotions into words and often falls asleep at her desk, writing a story about a fantasy world she calls Yellowstone.

She is conscious of the world in a way few eleven-year-olds are, and deeply patriotic. Despite her friendlessness, she carries on with good intentions and concern for the future. She bore witness to the atomic bombing of Vekllei in September of 2063.

If you have any questions, or painting tips you can give me, I’m hungry for either.
