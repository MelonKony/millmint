**Hi everyone**,

Hobart here, informing you that I have a **very** **good** **website**. It has every post I’ve ever made on it, for better or for worse (with the non-canon stuff marked). It has wiki pages that are growing all the time. It has fun things and essays. You can also leave comments!

[Just look at the home page](https://imgur.com/a/BA0nNV6). Isn’t that the coolest shit you’ve ever seen? You can see it live at [https://millmint.net](https://millmint.net) if you’re on desktop/tablet, and play with the trains.

Bonus: [Tzipora with some flowers](https://imgur.com/a/P9j0nS3).

Regular posts tomorrow & onwards.

Be “Petticoat”

Love,

**Hobart**/MelonKony
