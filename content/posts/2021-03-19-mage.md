**Tzipora is a sand mage.**

Actually, she isn’t, but I wanted to draw something with particles and ended up doing different paint sketches for a few hours. This was the best one, and also the most stupid.

Canonically, Tzipora can’t swim, so she spends more time on the beach than in the water. The colour of the sand here suggests it’s an artificial “white beach” in Mumen or nearby. Most beaches in Vekllei are black.

She’s wearing something between regular school uniform and [national dress](https://millmint.net/posts/2020-01-11-dress/). It’s a bit exaggerated here, but the gold plate and *gi* quarter-pleat are common enough ceremonial items. That’s how it works in practice — school uniforms are quite literally undecorated, simpler versions of national dress.

I don’t usually work in this style. It’s fun to learn new things, and reinvent yourself.

Anyway, this is just a sketch, not part of Ocean Month.

Thanks for hanging out.
