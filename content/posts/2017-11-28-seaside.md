**About this time of year, in the place between high summer and autumn, the weather is good in Vekllei**. Vekllei is too cold for crickets, but insects are out and the air hums with life  —  birds, helijets, and the soft noise an ocean breeze makes as it races toward the harbour, pulling on leaves and skirt hems along the way.

The Lola monorail carries tourists and workers between the district centre and the World Expo Tower. A medihelijet buzzes the top of the hill, circling for a place to land. In the distance a supersonic jet roars off to New York. It’s a great time to be alive.
Anchored far from the harbour is an enormous nuclear aircraft carrier. From the top of the hill you can see jets jump off and return to the deck like bees in the spring. It’s training season and the air force cadets are piloting jump-jets.

The days this time of year are almost twenty hours long  —  the nightlife is endless and exhausting. In winter Vekllei rests, sleepy, until springtime returns in late May.

The view from Lola is smaller than that of the rest of the city  —  the planned city of Vekllei is a few hillsides over, making Lola a wonderful location to raise a family. It feels quiet and small, and the city centre is only ten minutes away by hypertrain.

In this coming late autumn Vekllei will be struck by two nuclear bombs, and although Lola will be spared, the event will radically change life in the sprawling, utopian city of Vekllei.
