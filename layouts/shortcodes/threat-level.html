			An attack is possible, but not likely. This is because there are a few people in Vekllei and overseas who want to cause this country harm, and may pose a risk to public safety.

			The threat from scandinationalists and religious extremists has moderated. The ability for these groups to attack Vekllei have been substantially degraded, and support for these groups has declined. You do not need to change your daily behaviour or activities.

			An attack is likely. This is because extremists, including scandinationalists and religious fundamentalists, have support in Vekllei and overseas and may attempt to attack this country.
			<br>
			<br>
			Rising anti-government sentiment and anti-Vekllei extremist beliefs can create conditions for an attack. It is important that Vekllei people remain aware of their surroundings in busy public places and report suspicious activity.
